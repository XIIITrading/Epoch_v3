  AMD LONG | 2026-01-27 15:26:45
  Entry: $252.05 | Model: EPCH4 | Zone: SECONDARY

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (MEDIUM) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1/M15/M5 structure remains bullish which supports the LONG direction, and the spread is positive (+0.47) indicating favorable momentum. While the M1 structure has shifted bearish and recent delta shows some selling pressure (-22,418 on bar -1), the overall price action shows consolidation around the 252 level rather than aggressive selling. The range percentages are modest but not showing clear absorption, and the system's pre-qualification at this high-volume node warrants execution despite mixed M1 signals.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp), the extremely low average range of 0.088% puts us in an absorption zone where backtesting shows we should skip. The consistently low long scores (averaging 1.8) combined with the lack of meaningful price movement suggests this setup lacks the momentum needed for our 1.5R target despite the structural alignment.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 timeframe shows BEAR structure which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are consistently weak (0-2 range) across all recent bars with no improvement. Additionally, bars -6 through -2 show concerning negative delta despite positive spread, suggesting selling pressure into strength, which creates a poor risk/reward scenario against the higher timeframe bearish structure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our most powerful +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.052% << 0.12% threshold), and long scores are consistently weak. While SMA spread is aligned, it's insufficient to overcome the structural headwinds and lack of price movement.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 timeframe shows BEAR structure which is directly opposed to this LONG entry, and the Long scores are consistently weak (0-2 range) throughout the entire 15-bar sequence with no scores reaching even 4. Additionally, while there was initial buying pressure from bars -12 to -8 with strong positive delta, this was followed by consistent negative delta from bars -6 to -3, suggesting selling pressure took control and buyers were absorbed at these levels.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that significantly reduce win probability. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with very low range (0.052% vs needed 0.12%), and the long score is extremely weak at 0.4. While SMA spread is aligned, it cannot overcome the combination of opposed H1 structure and lack of meaningful price movement.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Actual: WIN | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with consistently negative delta from bars -6 through -1, culminating in extremely bearish delta of -23,382 at bar -1. All timeframe structures remain bearish (BEAR across H1/M15/M5/M1), and both Long and Short scores have collapsed to 0 in the final bar, indicating no directional conviction. The combination of heavy selling pressure, bearish structure alignment, and zero momentum scores creates a high-probability fade environment against this long entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags - H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with tiny 0.02% average range, and the consistently declining long scores (2->2->2->1->0) show deteriorating momentum. The heavy selling pressure with negative deltas in recent bars (-11,476, -18,208, -23,382) confirms the bearish environment is not conducive to a long position.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1/M15/M5 structure remains bullish throughout, supporting the long direction. While M1 structure turned bearish around bar -7, the final bar (-1) shows a recovery with positive delta (+8,433), increased range (0.17%), and improved long score (3->4). The spread remains positive (+0.57) and price action shows no clear absorption or major structural breakdown that would override the system's high-volume node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is fully present with H1 structure perfectly aligned for LONG direction. While the Long Score is low, we have good movement present (0.13% average range) and aligned SMA spread providing additional edge. The H1 alignment alone provides substantial win rate improvement well above our breakeven needs.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1/M15/M5 structure remains bullish throughout, supporting the LONG direction. While M1 flipped bearish in recent bars (-5 to -1), the long scores are consistently 1-3 (not extremely weak), and we see positive delta in bars -4, -3, -2 showing buying interest near this level. The range percentages show adequate movement (0.10-0.14%) without clear absorption patterns, making this acceptable for the system to work.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is present with H1 structure fully aligned for LONG direction. While we're in a marginal absorption zone (0.11% avg range) and long scores are weak, the SMA spread alignment provides additional support. The H1 alignment alone makes this statistically favorable despite weaker secondary indicators.

  Entry: $252.04 | Model: EPCH4 | Zone: SECONDARY

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (MEDIUM) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is supportive with H1/M15/M5 all BULL, and despite M1 flipping BEAR in recent bars, the longer timeframes provide favorable context. Recent bars show positive delta (buying pressure) with bars -3, -2, -1 showing +81k, +117k, +96k respectively, indicating continued buying interest. Range% is adequate at 0.11-0.14% on recent bars showing the market is moving, and the positive spread (+0.67) confirms bullish momentum alignment.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 structure alignment providing our strongest edge, the average range of 0.11% falls into the absorption zone (<0.12%) which backtesting shows we should skip. The consistently low long scores (1-2) over the last 5 bars indicate weak momentum, and M1 structure has flipped bearish. Multiple unfavorable factors outweigh the single positive H1 alignment in this secondary zone setup.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1/M15/M5 structure remains bullish throughout, providing strong multi-timeframe support for the long entry. Recent bars show positive delta (+81,612 and +117,613 in the last two bars) indicating buying pressure, with the final bar showing increased volume (97,489) and decent range (0.12%). While the M1 timeframe flipped to BEAR in the last few bars, the higher timeframe bullish structure and positive momentum into the entry support taking this trade.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp), which is the most critical factor for trade success. While the long scores are low and average range is just below the 0.12% threshold, the SMA spread alignment adds supporting edge. The combination of our strongest indicator being favorable with baseline positive expectancy makes this a viable trade despite weaker momentum signals.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) are consistently BEAR, creating strong structural headwinds for a LONG position. The Long scores are extremely weak (0-2 range) with Short scores consistently higher (1-3), indicating the system is flagging SHORT bias. Despite recent positive delta in bars -2 and -1, the structural opposition across all timeframes and persistently low Long scores present clear warning signs against this LONG entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple critical red flags that override our positive expectancy baseline. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.058% (well below the 0.12% threshold), and the long score is extremely weak at 0.8. While SMA spread is aligned, it cannot overcome the combination of structural opposition and lack of price movement energy.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are extremely poor (mostly 0-1, max of 2) throughout the entire 15-bar sequence. Despite strong positive delta in the final two bars (+71,674 and +119,312), the consistent structural opposition and persistently low long scores indicate this is fighting against the prevailing trend rather than working with it.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple strong negative factors. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (missing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with avg range of only 0.06% (well below the 0.12% threshold for the +13.5pp range edge), and long score is very low at 1.2. While SMA spread is aligned, it's not enough to overcome the major structural headwinds and lack of volatility expansion needed for this trade to succeed.

  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5) are BEAR while attempting a LONG entry, creating a strong structural headwind. The Long scores are consistently weak (0-1) throughout the entire sequence with Short scores higher, indicating the systematic bias favors the opposite direction. Despite positive delta in recent bars (-3 to -1), the multi-timeframe bearish alignment and consistently low volatility (Range% mostly <0.08%) suggest this long entry is fighting against the prevailing structure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Multiple red flags present - H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.066% (well below 0.12% threshold), and long scores are consistently weak at 0.4. Despite SMA spread alignment, the combination of opposed H1 structure and absorption zone conditions creates clearly unfavorable risk/reward dynamics that override the pre-qualification.

  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: While H1 structure remains bearish, the recent M1 price action shows clear bullish momentum building with strong buying pressure. The last three bars (-3, -2, -1) show consistent positive delta (+31,869, +32,567, +71,674) and an accelerating upward move from 673.33 to 673.94, with the final bar showing particularly strong volume and delta. The spread has turned positive (+0.27) and range percentages are adequate (0.06-0.07%), indicating legitimate price movement rather than absorption.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple major red flags that clearly override our positive expectancy baseline. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.062% (well below the 0.12% threshold), and the consistently low long scores (0-1 range) indicate weak bullish momentum.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final three bars (-3 to -1) show strong bullish momentum with positive delta values (+31,869, +32,567, +71,674) and increasing buying pressure, culminating in a wide momentum bar at entry. While all timeframes remain bearish, the recent price action shows clear accumulation and buying interest around this level, with the spread turning positive (+0.27) and short scores increasing to 3, indicating the system's high-volume-node identification is being validated by actual buying pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that overcome our positive baseline expectancy. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.062% (well below the 0.12% threshold for the +13.5pp range edge), and the long score is extremely low at 0.4.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: Despite all timeframes showing BEAR structure, the recent price action shows strong buying momentum with positive delta on the last 3 bars (+31,869, +32,567, +71,674) and price moving from 672.84 to 673.94. The final bar shows expansion with 0.06% range and momentum shift to WIDE, indicating buyers are stepping in at this zone. While structure is against us, the immediate price action supports the long entry with clear buying pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (missing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.062% (well below the 0.12% threshold for the +13.5pp range edge), and long scores are consistently low across all timeframes.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in the final bars before entry, with consistently negative delta (-10,213, -11,858, -17,105, -16,427) indicating strong selling pressure right at the entry zone. Additionally, all timeframes remain bearish (H1/M15/M5/M1 all BEAR) with low long scores (0-1), and the negative spread of +0.05 suggests the market structure hasn't shifted bullish despite the system identifying this as a high-volume node zone.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.014% << 0.12% threshold), and long scores are consistently near zero indicating weak bullish momentum.

The Long scores are consistently 0-1 (never reaching favorable levels), while Short scores show 1-2, indicating the system recognizes bearish bias. Additionally, the recent bars show concerning absorption patterns with very low Range% values (0.01-0.02%) despite positive delta, suggesting buying pressure is being absorbed rather than driving price higher.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear unfavorable conditions. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (eliminating our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with extremely low range (0.014% << 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which directly opposes this SHORT entry, and the Short scores are extremely weak (mostly 0-1, never reaching 4). Additionally, bars -2 and -1 show all timeframes aligning BULL right before entry, with the spread improving from -0.09 to -0.15, suggesting potential upward momentum rather than bearish continuation.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT direction), eliminating our +36pp edge and creating headwind. The average range is only 0.084%, well below the 0.12% absorption threshold, and short score is very weak at 1.0. With SMA spread also opposed and recent bars showing bullish momentum shift (M15/M5 flipped to BULL), this contradicts our backtested performance drivers.

  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1 at 15:00) shows a complete structural flip with H1/M15/M5/M1 all turning BULL just before entry, creating strong opposition to the SHORT. Additionally, this bar shows a significant bounce from 250.28 to 250.49 (+0.13% range) with massive volume (71,640), indicating potential buying absorption at this level. The structural alignment against the SHORT direction combined with the high-volume bounce creates clear warning signs that override the system's pre-qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags working against it. The H1 structure is OPPOSED (bullish when we're shorting), which removes our strongest +36pp edge and creates headwind. The average range is only 0.084%, well below the 0.12% absorption zone threshold, indicating weak momentum. While the SMA spread is aligned, this single positive factor cannot overcome the structural opposition and lack of volatility that typically leads to failed breakouts.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows a major structural shift with all timeframes (H1/M15/M5/M1) flipping to BULL right before entry, creating direct opposition to the SHORT setup. Additionally, this bar shows a strong bounce off the lows with high volume (71,640) and significant range (0.13%), suggesting buyers stepped in aggressively at this level. The momentum shift from sustained selling pressure (bars -4 to -2 with strong negative deltas) to this bullish reversal bar creates a clear warning against entering short at this precise moment.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that stack against us. H1 structure is opposed (our strongest edge working against us at -36pp), we're in an absorption zone with low range%, and short signals are extremely weak with conflicting momentum patterns. The recent bars show bullish momentum building (M15/M5/M1 all flipped bullish in final bar) right as we're trying to short, creating unfavorable entry timing despite the pre-qualification.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Actual: WIN | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and all timeframes (H1, M15, M5) are uniformly bearish. The Long scores are consistently 0 throughout the entire sequence, showing no systematic support for long positions. Additionally, the range percentages are extremely low (0.01-0.03%), indicating absorption and lack of meaningful price movement, while the negative spread (-0.03) confirms bearish momentum bias.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (loses our biggest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.014% << 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed. With consistently low long scores (0-1) across recent bars, this contradicts our backtested performance criteria for favorable LONG setups.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The setup shows strong selling pressure with negative delta on the last 3 bars (-55,547, -53,221, -92,802), indicating institutional selling into the entry zone. The recent high-volume rejection at bar -3 (69,096 volume) followed by continued selling pressure supports the short thesis. While H1 remains bullish, the M15/M5 bearish structure aligns with the short direction, and the increasing selling momentum into the entry provides good confirmation for this pre-qualified short setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that significantly reduce win probability. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), the short score is extremely low at 1.0, and we're in an absorption zone with average range below 0.12%. While SMA spread is aligned, it cannot overcome the combination of opposed H1 structure, weak momentum signals, and insufficient price movement.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action strongly supports this SHORT entry. Bars -3 to -1 show clear selling pressure with high volume (69K, 51K, 29K) and strong negative delta (-55K, -53K, -92K), indicating institutional selling into this high-volume node. The breakdown from 251+ to 250.40 with accelerating negative delta on bar -1 (-92K) confirms bearish momentum is building at the entry level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (bullish vs our short direction), eliminating our most powerful +36pp edge and creating headwind. The average range of 0.092% falls below our 0.12% absorption zone threshold, suggesting insufficient movement for our target. While SMA spread shows slight alignment, the low short score (1.0) and combination of structural opposition with low volatility creates an unfavorable risk profile that falls below our trading standards.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The recent bars (-2 and -1) show strong selling pressure with significant negative delta (-55,547 and -53,221) and good volume spikes (69,096 and 51,814), indicating momentum toward our SHORT direction. While H1 remains BULL, the M15/M5/M1 timeframes are aligned BEAR-BEAR-BULL, and the recent volatility (0.16% range on bar -2) shows the market is moving rather than absorbing. The setup shows classic rejection from the 251+ level with follow-through selling into our entry zone.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that stack against our strongest edges. The H1 structure is opposed (-36pp edge working against us), we're in the absorption zone with low range%, and the short score is very weak. While one negative factor might be acceptable, having our strongest edge working against us combined with weak momentum signals creates a clearly unfavorable setup that falls well below our baseline expectancy.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which directly opposes this SHORT entry, and the Short scores are extremely weak (mostly 0-1, never exceeding 3). Additionally, bars -12 through -8 show consistent positive delta indicating buying pressure, and the final two bars (-2, -1) with high volume and negative delta appear to be getting absorbed rather than creating sustainable selling momentum given the bullish higher timeframe context.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (strongest negative edge at -36pp), combined with consistently low short scores (avg 1.6) and below-threshold range activity (0.094% vs 0.12% needed). While SMA spread is aligned, the primary H1 edge working against us plus multiple supporting factors being unfavorable creates a clearly suboptimal setup that fails to meet our edge criteria.

While we see good selling pressure in the final two bars (-2 and -1) with strong negative deltas and higher volume, the overwhelming structural headwinds and consistently poor short scores indicate this setup is fighting against the dominant trend across multiple timeframes.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that override the system's pre-qualification. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with average range below 0.12% indicating lack of movement, and the short score is very low at 1.6.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: ** The H1 timeframe shows consistent BEAR structure throughout all 15 bars, which directly opposes this LONG entry. Additionally, the Long scores are extremely weak (0-1 range) for most bars, only reaching 2-3 in a few instances, well below the favorable threshold of 4+. While delta shows some buying pressure in the middle section (bars -10 to -6), the final bar shows strong selling pressure (-7,985 delta) with very low volume, suggesting weakness right before the entry point.

While H1 remains BULL, the M15/M5/M1 are all BEAR aligned with our SHORT direction, and the recent selling wave from 251.55 down to 250.59 creates a supportive setup for continued downside momentum.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish pressure with consistently negative delta on the final 4 bars (-12,594, -18,063, -13,030, -8,282), indicating strong selling into this level. All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5) remain bearish with only M1 briefly turning bullish at bar -4, and the Long scores are consistently low (0-1) throughout the sequence. This suggests the high-volume node is acting as resistance rather than support, making this a fade opportunity rather than a breakout.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple unfavorable conditions that clearly override our positive baseline expectancy. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with very low range (0.02% vs needed 0.12%), and the long score is extremely weak at 0.6.

Additionally, the multi-timeframe structure is heavily bullish with M15/M5/M1 all showing BULL, and the ranges are extremely narrow (<0.05% on most recent bars) suggesting absorption rather than breakdown momentum.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish absorption against this SHORT entry. Despite consistent positive delta across bars -4 to -1 (ranging from +15,278 to +29,315), the price barely moved higher with extremely tight ranges (<0.04%), indicating strong buying interest absorbing selling pressure. The H1 timeframe remains BEAR but all lower timeframes (M15, M5, M1) are BULL, and the Short scores are consistently low (0-2), showing the market structure is working against this SHORT setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple critical red flags working against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BEAR which should actually be ALIGNED for a SHORT (my initial assessment was wrong - BEAR structure supports SHORT direction), but the extremely low average range of 0.024% puts us deep in the absorption zone where we should skip trades entirely.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear opposition to a SHORT entry. All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5) are predominantly BULL, with M1 also showing BULL on the entry bar. The recent bars (-3 to -1) show strong positive delta values (+15,278, +29,315, +19,487) indicating persistent buying pressure right into the entry zone. Additionally, the spread has been consistently positive (+0.35-0.37) and the Short scores are extremely low (0-1) while Long scores remain elevated at 2, indicating the momentum structure strongly favors longs rather than shorts at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 BEAR alignment for SHORT +36pp), this setup shows clear red flags across multiple supporting indicators. The extremely low average range of 0.032% puts us in the "absorption zone" where we should skip trades, the short score is critically low at 1.0, and the positive SMA spread opposes our short direction. The combination of three negative factors outweighs the single positive H1 alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT setup with H1 BEAR but all other timeframes (M15, M5, M1) showing BULL, indicating we're shorting into bullish momentum on multiple timeframes. The positive spread (+0.35) confirms bullish bias, and critically, the recent bars show strong positive delta (+29,315 and +19,487 in bars -2 and -1) indicating heavy buying pressure right at our entry zone. The Short scores are consistently low (0-2) while this appears to be a buy-the-dip scenario in a bullish multi-timeframe structure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 structure alignment +36pp), this setup shows multiple clear unfavorable factors: we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.032% (well below 0.12% threshold), the short score is very low at 2.0, and the SMA spread is opposed to our direction. The combination of absorption conditions and poor supporting indicators outweighs the H1 alignment benefit.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear opposing signals for a SHORT entry. The spread has been consistently positive (+0.35 to +0.37) indicating bullish momentum, and delta has turned strongly positive in recent bars (+29,315 and +19,487 in the last two bars), showing significant buying pressure right into the entry zone. Additionally, the multi-timeframe structure shows M15, M5, and M1 all in BULL mode, creating a strong headwind against this SHORT position.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 alignment providing our strongest edge (+36pp), multiple critical factors are severely unfavorable. The average range of 0.032% is well below the 0.12% absorption zone threshold, indicating insufficient movement for our edge to manifest. The short score of 1.0 shows minimal bearish conviction, and the positive SMA spread directly opposes our short direction, suggesting underlying bullish momentum that could work against the trade.

The spread has been consistently positive (+0.25 to +0.37) indicating bullish momentum, and recent bars show strong positive delta (bars -3 to -1 have +15,278, +29,315, and +19,487 respectively) suggesting active buying pressure right into the entry zone. Additionally, the H1 timeframe is BEAR while M15/M5/M1 are predominantly BULL, creating conflicting structure, and the recent bars show very low volatility (0.02-0.04% range) suggesting potential absorption of selling pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our +36pp edge working against us), we're in the absorption zone with very low range, and the SMA spread is also opposed to our SHORT direction.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT entry with H1 BEAR but M15/M5/M1 all showing BULL alignment, creating opposing multi-timeframe pressure. More critically, the delta pattern shows consistent strong buying pressure (+29,315 and +19,487 in the last two bars before entry) combined with extremely low volatility (Range% of only 0.04% and 0.02%), indicating active absorption of selling pressure rather than distribution. The Short scores of 2 and below throughout the sequence confirm unfavorable conditions for a short entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having the strongest edge (H1 BEAR alignment +36pp), this setup shows clear absorption zone characteristics with extremely low range% (0.032% vs 0.12% threshold). The consistently low short scores and opposed SMA spread indicate bullish underlying conditions that conflict with the SHORT direction, creating a high-risk scenario that contradicts multiple backtested edges.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent bullish momentum with strong buying pressure in the final bars before entry - delta values of +29,315 and +19,487 in bars -2 and -1 indicate aggressive buying into the zone. Additionally, the H1 timeframe remains BEAR while all lower timeframes (M15, M5, M1) are BULL, creating a conflicted structure, and the spread has been consistently positive (+0.35-0.37) indicating bullish momentum that hasn't shown signs of exhaustion at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple critical red flags - the H1 BEAR structure creates a massive -36pp headwind for our SHORT, the extremely low range% (0.03%) indicates we're in an absorption zone with minimal movement, and the consistently low short scores show no bearish momentum. With our strongest edge working heavily against us plus poor supporting conditions, this clearly falls into the "CLEARLY BAD setup" category that should be rejected.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in buying interest over the last 7 bars, with consistently negative delta values ranging from -37,460 to -102,353, indicating sustained selling pressure. Additionally, the last 5 bars show extremely low volatility (Range% of 0.02-0.07%) suggesting price absorption rather than bullish momentum. While the multi-timeframe structure remains supportive, the immediate M1 action directly contradicts the long bias with selling pressure dominating right at the entry point.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (H1 Structure alignment) is fully favorable, providing a +36pp win rate boost.

While recent bars (-4 to -1) show negative delta indicating some selling pressure, the range percentages are relatively low (0.03-0.07%) suggesting consolidation rather than aggressive selling. The positive spread (+0.10%) and overall bullish higher timeframe alignment outweigh the short-term negative delta, making this a reasonable system entry to take.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is fully present with H1 structure aligned BULL for this LONG trade. While the range is in the absorption zone (<0.12%) which historically reduces win rates, and the long score is low, the SMA spread alignment provides additional support.

The earlier strong buying pressure in bars -9 and -8 (delta +211K and +267K) suggests underlying bullish sentiment, and the current pullback appears to be normal consolidation rather than structural breakdown.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is firmly in our favor with H1 structure aligned bullish for this long trade.

The Short scores remain consistently low (0-2) throughout the entire sequence, indicating weak short-side conviction even as price approaches the entry zone.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags that align against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to our SHORT), which costs us our biggest +36pp edge.

Most critically, the H1 timeframe remains BULL while all shorter timeframes are BEAR, creating a structural conflict where we're shorting against the dominant higher timeframe trend. The narrowing spread from -0.24 to 0.00 also suggests the bearish momentum is weakening right at our entry point.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (BULL vs SHORT), which removes our strongest edge (-36pp impact). Additionally, the average range is below the 0.12% threshold needed for favorable movement, putting us in the "absorption zone" that backtesting suggests we should skip.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) are strongly BULL, directly opposing this SHORT entry. The recent bars show consistent positive delta (+52,396, +63,980, +58,848 on bars -3 to -1) indicating persistent buying pressure, and the spread has turned negative but is improving toward zero (-0.21 to -0.15), suggesting potential bullish momentum continuation. With Short scores consistently at 0-1 versus Long scores of 1-4, the price action clearly contradicts the SHORT thesis.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup faces significant headwinds with H1 structure opposed (-36pp edge working against us), extremely low short score indicating weak bearish momentum, and average range just below the 0.12% threshold where we see absorption zones. While SMA spread is aligned, the combination of our strongest negative edge (H1 opposition) plus weak momentum signals creates an unfavorable risk profile that falls below our positive expectancy threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and we see positive delta development from bars -11 through -7 indicating buying interest in this zone. While the most recent bars show some selling pressure (negative delta at -2 and -1), the overall structure remains intact and the entry aligns with a potential bounce off the 243.30s support level that held at bar -2 with high volume.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp), the average range of 0.10% falls into the absorption zone below our 0.12% threshold, which historically shows +13.5pp improvement when exceeded. The consistently low Long scores (averaging 0.6) combined with the absorption zone conditions suggest price action lacks the momentum needed for our 1.5R target, despite the structural alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in buying pressure with consistently negative delta from bars -15 through -1 (except for a brief positive period from -9 to -4), indicating sellers are in control. The recent bars show declining momentum with very low range% values (0.05% on bars -5, -1) suggesting absorption, and the Long score has been stuck at 0 for the past 8 bars while Short score remains elevated at 1-2. Despite bullish higher timeframe structure, the M1 action shows sellers dominating and buyers unable to generate sustained pressure at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp, being perfectly aligned with the long direction. However, the extremely low range% (0.071%) suggests we're in an absorption zone with minimal price movement, and the low long scores indicate weak momentum. Despite these concerns, the H1 alignment edge is so significant that it overrides the negative factors, maintaining positive expectancy above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: ** The structure is supportive with H1/M15/M5 all BULL, providing favorable multi-timeframe alignment for the LONG direction. While the Long scores are low (0-2 range), there's a clear shift from heavy selling pressure in bars -15 to -13 (delta -67K to -270K) to consistent buying pressure from bar -9 onward (positive deltas +27K to +67K), indicating demand absorption around this price level. The recent bars show modest volatility (0.05-0.14% range) with no major red flags, and the entry aligns with where buyers have been stepping in consistently.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge (+36pp), which is the primary factor for trade decisions. While the low range suggests an absorption zone and SMA spread is opposed, the H1 bull alignment in a PRIMARY zone with positive expectancy outweighs these concerns. The setup meets our threshold for acceptable risk-reward given the system's baseline performance.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in buying interest with predominantly negative delta from bars -15 through -1 (especially the heavy selling in bars -14 and -13 with -213K and -270K delta respectively). While there was a brief period of positive delta from bars -9 to -4, it quickly faded with bar -1 showing negative delta again. Most concerning is the consistently low Long scores (0-2 range) and low volatility (Range% mostly under 0.10%), indicating absorption and lack of genuine buying momentum despite the higher timeframe bullish structure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest H1 alignment edge (+36pp), this setup shows clear absorption characteristics with very low range% (0.07% avg) which our backtesting indicates we should skip. The consistently low long scores (0-1) and opposed SMA spread further confirm weak momentum conditions that could negate the structural advantage.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The M1 price action shows clear deterioration in buying pressure with consistently negative delta from bars -13 through -9 (ranging from -67,968 to -276,739), indicating strong selling absorption in this zone. While the recent bars -8 through -1 show positive delta attempting to recover, the momentum is weak with declining volume and the M1 timeframe has flipped to BEAR. The Long scores are extremely low (0-2 range) throughout the entire sequence, suggesting the market microstructure is not supportive of long entries at this level despite the higher timeframe bullish structure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 alignment providing our strongest edge, multiple unfavorable factors create a poor setup. The average range of 0.08% indicates we're in an absorption zone where price movement is constrained, and the negative SMA spread shows underlying weakness for a LONG position. The consistently low long scores (0-1 range) across recent bars suggest lack of buying momentum needed for this direction.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in buying pressure with consistently negative delta from bars -11 through -8 (ranging from -213k to -277k), indicating strong selling absorption. Additionally, the M1 timeframe has flipped to BEAR with Long scores at 0 across the final 8 bars, while Range% has compressed to very low levels (0.04-0.09%) suggesting the market is absorbing buying interest rather than responding to it. Despite higher timeframe bullishness, the immediate M1 action directly opposes this long entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 alignment +36pp), multiple critical factors are clearly unfavorable. The average range of 0.054% is in the absorption zone where we should skip trades, the consistently zero long scores indicate no momentum support, and the negative SMA spread directly opposes our long direction. This combination of low volatility and opposing momentum indicators overrides the structural alignment advantage.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The setup shows supportive structure with H1 BULL but M15/M5/M1 all BEAR, creating a pullback scenario favorable for shorts. The recent bars (-2, -1) show strong selling pressure with negative deltas (-43K, -29K) and decent volatility (0.19%, 0.13%), indicating active selling into the zone. While H1 is still bullish, the lower timeframe bearish alignment and negative spread (-0.16) support the short entry at this resistance level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Multiple critical red flags align against this SHORT setup. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in the absorption zone with avg range <0.12%, and short score is very low at 1.6.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure remains bullish which supports the long direction, and recent bars show positive delta indicating buying pressure (bars -4 through -1 all show positive delta). While the range has compressed below 0.10% in recent bars suggesting some absorption, the overall price action shows stabilization around current levels rather than clear rejection, and the system's high-volume-node identification suggests this could be a consolidation before continuation.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 structure alignment worth +36pp), this setup has multiple clear red flags that stack against us. The extremely low average range of 0.056% puts us in the "absorption zone" where movement is minimal, and the negative SMA spread directly opposes our LONG direction. With Long scores consistently at 0 and the market showing narrow, sideways action after the earlier selling pressure, the risk of getting stuck in consolidation outweighs the structural alignment advantage.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong selling pressure with -43,143 delta and high volume (72,992) driving price down to 250.40, creating momentum toward our 250.42 entry. Structure is aligned with M15/M5/M1 all BEAR and spread turning increasingly negative (-0.13), supporting the SHORT direction. The recent volatility (0.19% range on bar -1) confirms the market is moving rather than absorbing, and the Short score of 3 on the final bar is acceptable given the strong directional momentum.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (BULL vs SHORT direction), which works against our +36pp edge. The average range of 0.07% is well below our 0.12% threshold for meaningful movement, indicating we're in an absorption zone. Combined with a very low short score of 1.4, this lacks the technical momentum needed for a successful short entry.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish momentum despite bullish higher timeframes. From bars -8 to -5, we see massive negative delta (-213K, -270K, -230K, -276K) indicating heavy selling pressure, followed by weak buying attempts in the final bars with much smaller positive deltas.

  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is significant enough to overcome the unfavorable short-term conditions. While the low range and opposed SMA spread are concerning, the price action shows recent recovery from the 13:42 selling pressure with positive delta in the last few bars, suggesting potential momentum shift.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in buying pressure with persistent negative delta from bars -7 through -4 (-213K, -271K, -231K, -277K), indicating heavy selling absorption in this zone. The M1 structure flipped to BEAR and Long scores collapsed from 2 to 0-1, while Short scores remain low, suggesting neither direction has clear momentum. Despite the recovery in delta on bars -2 and -1, the volume profile shows this area has been rejecting higher prices with significant selling pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite the strong H1 alignment edge, multiple factors are clearly unfavorable - we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.066% vs 0.12% threshold), consistently low long scores, and opposed SMA spread indicating negative momentum.

While there was significant selling pressure (negative delta) from bars -7 to -4 around the 243.05-243.17 zone, the recent bars (-2 to -1) show a return to positive delta with increasing volume, suggesting buying interest is re-emerging at this level. The price action appears to be finding support in this zone rather than showing clear breakdown signals.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite weak supporting indicators, the H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which alone pushes this trade well above breakeven probability.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear selling pressure developing over the last 5 bars (-6 to -2), with consistently negative delta ranging from -213K to -277K, indicating strong absorption of buying interest in this zone. Bar -6 shows a massive volume spike (218K) with heavy selling (-213K delta), followed by continued negative delta despite the system identifying this as a high-volume node. The recent bars show diminishing volatility (Range% dropping to 0.04-0.06%) combined with persistent selling pressure, suggesting the zone is acting as resistance rather than support for a long entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite short-term headwinds (low momentum scores, minimal range, opposed SMA spread), the H1 structure alignment provides our strongest statistical edge at +36pp above baseline. The recent selling pressure from bars -6 to -2 appears to be stabilizing with the final bar showing positive delta recovery. While this isn't our cleanest setup, the primary edge combined with system pre-qualification maintains positive expectancy.

The Short scores remain consistently low at 0-2 throughout the entire sequence, showing no technical support for the short entry despite the system qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 alignment providing our strongest edge (+36pp), this setup faces multiple severe headwinds. The average range of 0.018% is far below our 0.12% threshold, indicating we're in an absorption zone where price movement is minimal. Additionally, the SMA spread is opposed to our SHORT direction, and the consistently low short scores (all 2s) suggest weak bearish momentum, creating a confluence of unfavorable conditions that override the structural alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear absorption and buying pressure against this SHORT setup. Despite all timeframes being BEAR, the delta has been consistently positive (+11,749 on the entry bar) indicating strong buying interest, while range% has been extremely low (<0.03% on most recent bars) showing price is being absorbed rather than moving. The Short scores remain at 2 or below throughout the sequence, well below the 4 threshold, indicating the system itself isn't seeing strong SHORT conviction at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite the strongest H1 structure alignment (+36pp edge), multiple unfavorable factors create significant headwinds. The extremely low average range of 0.018% indicates we're in an absorption zone where price movement is constrained, and the opposed SMA spread suggests underlying bullish momentum that conflicts with our SHORT direction. The combination of absorption conditions plus opposed momentum overrides the structural edge.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish absorption against the short setup. Despite consistent negative spread throughout (-0.26 to +0.22), there's been sustained strong buying pressure with positive delta in 10 of the last 15 bars, including massive +23,981 delta on the entry bar. The combination of very low range% (0.02%) and extreme positive delta on bar -1 indicates professional buying absorption at this level, directly opposing the short thesis.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp), this setup has multiple significant red flags. The extremely low range (0.022% avg) indicates we're in an absorption zone where price movement is minimal, and the opposed SMA spread further reduces our edge. The combination of absorption-level ranges with opposed spread momentum creates unfavorable conditions that outweigh the structural alignment benefit.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish absorption against the SHORT setup. Despite consistent negative delta in early bars (-15 to -6), the market has absorbed all selling pressure from bars -5 through -1 with increasingly positive delta (+5,164 to +23,981) while price remains stable around 489.20-489.27. This absorption pattern, combined with consistently low Short scores (0-2) and narrow ranges, indicates strong buying interest that directly opposes the SHORT entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 structure alignment providing our strongest edge, this setup shows clear red flags that override the positive signal. The average range of 0.022% indicates we're in an absorption zone where price movement is minimal, and our backtested rules explicitly state to "SKIP if Absorption Zone (<0.12%)". Additionally, the very low short score of 2.0 and opposed SMA spread create multiple unfavorable conditions that collectively suggest this trade lacks the momentum needed for success.

Bars -10 through -1 show consistently positive delta with strong buying pressure (+11,180, +7,781, +17,110, +16,923, +20,522), indicating aggressive accumulation. The final two bars before entry (-2 and -1) have exceptionally strong positive delta (+16,923 and +20,522) with decent volume, suggesting buyers are stepping in aggressively at this level - exactly the opposite of what we want for a short entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp), which is the dominant factor here. While the low range suggests we're in an absorption zone and the SMA spread is opposed, the pre-qualified EPOCH system setup combined with the powerful H1 alignment maintains positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is aligned with H1/M15/M5/M1 all BEAR, supporting the SHORT direction. While recent bars show mixed delta with some buying pressure (bars -9 through -1), the overall trend shows weakening momentum after the initial bounce from 488.64 to 489.27. The entry at 489.22 comes after a small pullback from the 489.27 high, positioning well for continuation of the bearish structure despite the temporary buying pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp) which significantly outweighs the opposing factors.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is aligned with H1/M15/M5/M1 all showing BEAR, which supports the SHORT direction. While recent bars show mixed delta with some buying pressure (bars -9 through -1 showing positive delta), the overall trend from 13:12-13:20 shows price climbing from 488.94 to 489.27 on mixed volume, suggesting potential exhaustion near the entry level of 489.24. The spread has been improving (moving from negative toward positive) but volatility remains low with most Range% under 0.10%, indicating we're in a consolidation phase where the systematic edge should be respected.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest H1 structure edge (+36pp), this setup shows multiple clear red flags. The average range of 0.022% indicates we're in an absorption zone where price isn't moving meaningfully, and the positive SMA spread directly opposes our SHORT direction. The extremely low short score (1.6) combined with these technical factors creates a setup that falls well below our quality threshold, even for a system with positive baseline expectancy.

Despite H1 being BULL, all lower timeframes (M15/M5/M1) are BEAR with consistently low Long scores (0-2 range), and the recent bars show minimal range movement (<0.04%) suggesting potential absorption at this level rather than bullish momentum.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge (+36pp), which is decisive for this trade. While the low range and opposed SMA spread are unfavorable, the H1 bull alignment for a LONG trade historically adds significant win rate improvement that outweighs these concerns.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows overwhelming bearish pressure with persistent negative delta across all 15 bars, including massive selling pressure of -99,148 and -104,524 delta in bars -11 and -9. Despite the final bar showing positive delta of +54,078, this appears to be absorption rather than genuine buying interest given the consistently wide spreads (-0.22 to -0.29) and all timeframes remaining bearish. The brief uptick in the last bar is insufficient to overcome the dominant selling flow that has characterized this entire sequence.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite the strong H1 alignment edge (+36pp), multiple negative factors converge here - we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.076%), the SMA spread is opposed to our LONG direction, and the recent long score is extremely weak (0.2). The combination of absorption zone conditions and opposing technical indicators outweighs the single positive structural factor.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent and strong selling pressure with negative delta across all 15 bars until the very last bar, indicating sustained distribution. All timeframes except H1 are bearish (M15/M5/M1 all BEAR), creating a hostile multi-timeframe environment for longs. The final bar's positive delta (+54,078) appears to be isolated buying against the prevailing bearish momentum, making this a low-probability long setup despite the system qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge at +36pp, which is significant enough to overcome the unfavorable supporting indicators. While the low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone and the SMA spread is opposed, the H1 alignment historically transforms trades from ~47% baseline to ~83% win rate.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent and overwhelming selling pressure with negative delta across all 15 bars (-4,150 to -104,524), indicating strong absorption of any buying attempts. All lower timeframes (M15, M5, M1) are bearish while H1 remains bullish, creating a clear multi-timeframe conflict. The momentum has been consistently negative with wide spreads (-0.27 to -0.29) and declining long scores (mostly 0-1), suggesting the market is rejecting higher prices in this zone despite the system identifying it as a high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Multiple critical red flags align against this trade. The H1 structure is opposed to our LONG direction (losing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with average range well below the 0.12% threshold needed for meaningful movement, and the consistently low long scores (mostly 0s) indicate weak bullish momentum.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows sustained heavy selling pressure with consistently negative delta values from -32k to -104k across all 15 bars, indicating strong institutional selling. Despite the entry being at a pre-qualified high-volume node, the relentless selling absorption combined with all timeframes being bearish (H1 BULL vs M15/M5/M1 all BEAR) and consistently low long scores (0-1) suggests the selling pressure is too strong to fade at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite mixed supporting indicators, the H1 BULL structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp) which significantly outweighs the negatives. The low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone, but the primary H1 alignment keeps this trade viable given our 47% baseline and positive expectancy requirements.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All timeframes show BEAR structure which strongly supports the SHORT direction. While delta has been mixed with some buying pressure in recent bars, the overall trend shows decreasing momentum (volume dropping from 13K to 6K) and price action is forming a small pullback pattern around the 489.20-489.40 area before rejecting back to entry level. The narrow spreads and low range percentages suggest consolidation rather than strong bullish momentum, making this an acceptable SHORT entry at the system-identified high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has significant structural headwinds despite H1 alignment. The average range of 0.022% puts us firmly in the absorption zone where we should skip trades per the backtested rules. The low short score of 1.8 indicates weak selling pressure, and the positive/widening SMA spread opposes our short direction. While H1 structure alignment normally provides our strongest edge (+36pp), the combination of absorption-level ranges and opposing momentum indicators creates unfavorable conditions that outweigh the structural advantage.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is supportive with all timeframes showing BEAR alignment, which favors the SHORT direction. While the delta shows mixed buying/selling pressure in recent bars, the spread has moved from negative (-0.30) toward positive but remains supportive territory. The range percentages are generally low (mostly <0.03%) indicating some chop, but not severe absorption that would invalidate the setup - this appears to be normal consolidation before a potential move.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 structure alignment), this setup fails on multiple critical factors. The average range of 0.022% puts us deep in the absorption zone where backtesting shows we should skip trades entirely. Additionally, the short score is very low at 1.8, and the SMA spread is working against us, creating a confluence of unfavorable conditions that override the H1 alignment benefit.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly opposed to this SHORT - H1 remains BULL throughout the entire sequence while M1 only turned BEAR on the final bar, indicating we're fighting the dominant trend. More critically, bars -5 through -3 show massive positive delta (+61K, +109K, +111K) representing significant buying absorption in this zone, followed by immediate volatility collapse in bars -2 and -1 (Range% dropping to 0.07% and 0.13% with volume drying up). This pattern suggests strong institutional buying support at these levels rather than distribution.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows clear opposition across our strongest edges - H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT), giving us a -36pp disadvantage on our most powerful indicator. The short score is very low at 2.4, and SMA spread is also opposed to our direction. While we barely meet the range threshold, the combination of multiple unfavorable factors creates a clearly negative expectancy setup that falls well below our profitable baseline.

While recent delta has been mixed with some buying pressure, the final two bars show negative delta (-2,435 and -618) suggesting selling is emerging. The range has compressed to narrow levels but this often precedes continuation moves, and with a pre-qualified high-volume node entry, the setup appears technically sound.

While delta has been positive (buying pressure) in recent bars 10-2, this actually creates better SHORT entry conditions as it represents potential absorption at resistance. The range percentages are modest but adequate (0.01-0.05%), and the negative spread throughout the sequence confirms bearish momentum context for the entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 structure aligned +36pp), this setup shows multiple clear red flags. The average range of 0.02% puts us in the absorption zone where we should skip trades, the short score is critically low at 1.0, and the wide negative SMA spread opposes our short direction.

  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 structure alignment providing our strongest edge (+36pp), this setup shows critical weaknesses that override the positives. The average range of only 0.020% is far below our 0.12% threshold for adequate movement, indicating we're in an absorption zone where price action lacks conviction. The consistently low short scores (0-1) across recent bars suggest minimal selling pressure to drive the move through our target.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear opposition to a SHORT entry. The final bar (-1) exhibits strong buying pressure with +36,988 delta and a 0.16% range, pushing price from 333.21 to 333.68 - a significant move higher right into our SHORT entry at 333.39. Additionally, the Short scores are extremely weak (mostly 1-2, with final bars at 4), while H1 structure remains BULL, creating multiple headwinds against this SHORT position.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT direction), eliminating our strongest +36pp edge and creating headwind. The average range of 0.11% falls into the absorption zone below our 0.12% threshold, and all momentum/structure indicators are misaligned with the SHORT direction. With our primary edge working against us and supporting indicators also unfavorable, this presents a clearly unfavorable setup.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear opposition to a SHORT entry. Delta remains strongly positive throughout (+17,367 to +144,406), indicating persistent buying pressure even near the entry point. Bar -1 shows the first negative delta at -13,302, but this is insufficient to overcome the consistent bullish flow, and the H1 structure remains BULL while spread is positive (+0.25), creating unfavorable conditions for a short position.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest backtested edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT direction), we're in an absorption zone with low range, and short scores are very weak. The combination of our strongest negative edge (-36pp for opposing H1 structure) plus absorption zone conditions creates a clearly unfavorable setup that falls well below our positive expectancy threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows strong opposing signals for a SHORT entry. All recent bars (-15 to -1) display heavily positive delta ranging from +17,367 to +144,406, indicating persistent buying pressure rather than selling. Additionally, the Short scores are consistently low (0-2) while M1 structure has shifted to BULL in the final bars, directly contradicting the SHORT direction at this entry point.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has our strongest negative edge with H1 structure completely opposed (-36pp), combined with consistently low short scores and ranges in the absorption zone that backtesting suggests skipping. While we typically favor trading, having multiple key indicators clearly unfavorable (especially the most powerful H1 structure edge working against us) creates a clearly bad setup that falls well below our positive expectancy threshold.

The Short scores are extremely weak (0-2 range) while spread remains positive (+0.25), and the recent bars show M1 structure flipping to BULL, creating multiple confluent warning signs against this SHORT entry.

The average range of 0.088% falls well below our 0.12% threshold, indicating we're in an absorption zone where the +13.5pp range edge doesn't apply.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent negative delta across the final 5 bars (-35,447, -60,134, -71,703, -57,414), indicating persistent selling pressure right into the entry point. Additionally, the Long scores are extremely weak (0-3 range) throughout the entire sequence, with the final bar showing only a 2 Long score despite some price recovery. The combination of heavy selling flow and poor momentum scores directly contradicts the LONG setup, creating clear warning signs against this entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge at +36pp, which is significant enough to overcome the low long score and opposed SMA spread. The adequate range percentage suggests sufficient movement for proper execution. While supporting indicators are mixed, the primary structural edge combined with our positive baseline expectancy justifies taking this pre-qualified SECONDARY zone trade.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which supports the LONG direction, and recent bars show decent volatility (0.22% range on bar -1, 0.21% on bar -6). While the delta pattern shows mixed buying/selling pressure with the last bar showing selling (-35,447), the overall setup isn't showing clear absorption or strong opposing structure that would warrant avoiding this pre-qualified trade.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is massive and overrides other weaknesses. While the low long score and opposed SMA spread are concerning, the average range above 0.12% shows decent movement potential, and we're in a SECONDARY zone with 59.82% mid-performance. The H1 alignment alone should push this well above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and the final three bars (-3 to -1) show improving conditions with increasing volume, positive delta emergence (+2,370 and +42,758), and expanding ranges (0.02% to 0.04%). While the M15 flipped BEAR and spreads are negative, the recent price action shows buying pressure developing at this level, which aligns with the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 structure alignment providing our strongest edge (+36pp), multiple critical factors are clearly unfavorable. The average range of 0.024% is well below our 0.12% threshold, indicating we're in an absorption zone where price movement is constrained. Additionally, the SMA spread is opposed to our long direction and the long score is very low at 0.6, showing lack of momentum support. This combination of low volatility environment and opposing technical factors outweighs the structural alignment edge.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action strongly supports the SHORT entry. Structure shifted bearish on H1 and M15 at bar -4 (12:15) and has remained bearish, while consistent negative delta from bars -8 through -1 shows persistent selling pressure with values reaching -55,920 at bar -2. The momentum is clearly downward with adequate volatility (0.03-0.05% range) and Short scores of 1 indicating favorable conditions for the systematic entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure ALIGNED for SHORT direction. While we're in an absorption zone with low range% and poor short scores, the SMA spread alignment provides additional support. The H1 alignment edge is so significant that it overcomes the weaker supporting indicators, maintaining positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and the final bar (-1) shows positive delta (+2,370) indicating buying interest near the entry level. While the Long scores are low (1-2 range), this appears to be a potential reversal setup at a system-identified support zone, and there's no clear structural breakdown or heavy absorption pattern that would contradict the systematic entry signal.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp), multiple negative factors create significant headwinds. The extremely low average range (0.02% vs 0.12% threshold) suggests we're in an absorption zone where price movement is constrained, and the negative SMA spread opposes our LONG direction.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and the final bar shows positive delta (+2,370) indicating buying pressure at entry. While M15 flipped to BEAR around bar -4, the H1 timeframe takes precedence and recent bars show increasing volume with the last two bars having Long scores of 1-2, suggesting some supportive momentum building into the entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite the strongest H1 alignment edge (+36pp), we have concerning absorption zone conditions with extremely low range% (0.020% vs 0.12% threshold) which historically shows poor performance. The opposed SMA spread and consistently low long scores across recent bars create multiple unfavorable factors that outweigh the structural alignment in this low-volatility environment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent selling pressure with negative delta across almost all bars (-15 through -2), indicating sustained absorption of buying interest. The market structure has deteriorated with M15 flipping from BULL to BEAR (bars -3 to -1), and Long scores remain extremely weak at 0-1 throughout most of the sequence. Despite the entry being at a high-volume node, the persistent negative delta and structural breakdown suggest institutional selling that would likely overwhelm any bounce attempt.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite the strong H1 alignment edge, this setup shows multiple unfavorable conditions. The average range of 0.018% puts us clearly in the "absorption zone" where the backtested edge specifically recommends to SKIP. Additionally, the consistently low long scores (mostly 0s) and opposed SMA spread create a confluence of negative factors that outweigh the H1 structure advantage.

The final bar (-1) shows a significant drop to 695.48 with -88k delta, moving further away from the 695.45 entry level, suggesting continued downward momentum. Despite bullish higher timeframe structure, the M1 price action demonstrates strong selling activity that directly opposes this long entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp), multiple other factors are clearly unfavorable. The average range of 0.018% is well below the 0.12% absorption zone threshold, indicating weak price movement.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action strongly supports this SHORT entry. We see consistent negative delta building from -18,689 to -47,786 in the final 4 bars, indicating accelerating selling pressure. The H1 structure turned BEAR at bar -2, M15/M5/M1 all remain BEAR, and the negative spread of -0.45 confirms downward momentum - all factors align perfectly for a short entry at this high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest H1 structure alignment (+36pp edge), the average range of only 0.028% places this firmly in the absorption zone where the backtested guidance explicitly says to "SKIP if Absorption Zone (<0.12%)". The extremely low volatility environment suggests price is consolidating rather than trending, which undermines the effectiveness of our directional trade even with structural alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear selling pressure developing from bars -8 through -1, with consistently negative delta values (ranging from -30k to -119k) and declining prices from 167.67 to 167.13. While H1 structure remains BEAR-friendly and the recent bars show adequate volatility (0.08-0.24% range), the spread is widening negative (-0.20) which supports the SHORT direction. The systematic pullback with sustained selling pressure aligns well with the pre-qualified SHORT entry at 167.00.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is opposed (missing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with low range% that our backtesting says to skip, short scores are extremely weak, and SMA spread is working against the direction.

While H1 shows BEAR structure (favorable for SHORT), the recent momentum and volume profile indicate strong downside pressure that aligns perfectly with the systematic entry signal.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 BEAR alignment +36pp), this setup falls into the absorption zone with avg range <0.12%, which backtesting shows we should SKIP. The consistently low short scores (averaging 2.2) indicate weak bearish momentum, creating a conflict between structural alignment and price action momentum that suggests waiting for a clearer setup.

The pullback from 167.67 to entry at 166.97 demonstrates legitimate selling pressure, not just chop or absorption. While H1 structure is BEAR (supportive) and recent bars show adequate range/volatility, the strong negative delta pattern aligns perfectly with the systematic entry signal.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp, creating significant positive expectancy despite other unfavorable conditions. While the low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone and the short score is weak, the primary structural alignment alone makes this a statistically favorable trade. The PRE-QUALIFIED EPOCH system already filtered this setup, and rejecting a +36pp edge would require multiple severe red flags, which aren't present here.

From bars -6 to -1, we see consistent negative delta (-47K, -24K, -15K, -37K, -21K, -25K) indicating selling pressure, while M5 and M1 timeframes have flipped to BEAR with Long scores stuck at 0. The final bar shows significant volume (74K) with heavy selling pressure (-25K delta) and a close near lows (251.94), suggesting institutional selling rather than a supportive setup despite the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is massive and overrides other concerns. While the long score is low and SMA spread is opposed, the average range of 0.12% meets our threshold for adequate movement. The H1 alignment alone transforms this from a ~47% baseline to potentially ~83% win rate, making this a statistically favorable setup despite mixed supporting indicators.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: Clear deterioration in momentum and delta from bars -6 onwards, with consistent negative delta (-47k, -24k, -15k, -37k, -21k, -25k) showing sustained selling pressure into the entry. The M1 structure flipped to BEAR at bar -6 and remained bearish through entry, while Long scores dropped to 0 and stayed there until spiking only at the final bar. This price action shows active selling absorption rather than supportive buying, directly opposing the LONG setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp), which is decisive despite other indicators being unfavorable. The low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone, but the consistent positive volume delta in early bars and the pre-qualified SECONDARY zone status support taking this trade. The H1 alignment alone moves us well above breakeven threshold.

  Actual: WIN | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT - H1 is BEAR but M15 is BULL, creating conflicting signals. More critically, the recent price action shows consistent buying pressure with positive deltas from bars -10 through -4, followed by a significant volume spike at bar -1 (22,544) with negative delta (-18,912), suggesting potential absorption of selling rather than genuine bearish momentum. The spread remains positive (+0.25) and Short scores are consistently weak (1-3 range), indicating the systematic setup may be fighting against the prevailing micro-trend.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 alignment +36pp), this setup has multiple severe weaknesses. The extremely low range (0.024% vs 0.12% threshold) suggests we're in an absorption zone where price movement is minimal, and the low short score indicates weak bearish momentum. While H1 alignment normally provides strong edge, the combination of minimal volatility and lack of directional conviction creates unfavorable conditions that likely override the structural advantage.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish momentum with consistent positive delta across all recent bars, indicating strong buying pressure rather than selling. The massive volume spike at 11:32 (136,808 volume) with +82,922 delta suggests institutional buying absorption, and price has been steadily climbing from 490.95 to 491.50 with diminishing range% indicating potential exhaustion but not reversal. All timeframes except H1 are showing BEAR structure, but the positive delta and upward price drift contradict the SHORT thesis at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 structure alignment providing our strongest edge, this setup shows clear absorption characteristics with extremely low range% (0.022% vs 0.12% threshold) and consistently low short scores. The price action shows minimal movement potential in what appears to be a consolidation phase, which our backtesting suggests we should skip to avoid low-probability trades.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish absorption against this SHORT setup. From bars -8 to -4, we see massive cumulative buying delta (+511,482 total) with price grinding higher from 491.22 to 491.43, indicating strong institutional accumulation. The H1 timeframe is BEAR while M15 is BULL, creating conflicting signals, and the consistently low Short scores (0-3) throughout the sequence show the system itself recognizes unfavorable conditions for shorting at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 alignment providing our strongest edge, this setup shows clear absorption characteristics with extremely low range% (0.024% vs 0.12% threshold) and consistently low short scores averaging only 2.0. The backtested edges specifically indicate to "SKIP if Absorption Zone (<0.12%)" and the weak momentum/range suggests insufficient movement to reach our 1.5R target despite the structural alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear warning signs against this SHORT entry. From bars -5 to -1, there's persistent strong buying pressure with massive positive delta values (+82,922 to +123,712), indicating heavy accumulation right before the entry. Additionally, the H1 timeframe is BEAR while M15 is BULL, creating conflicting signals, and the Short scores are extremely low (1-2) throughout the recent bars, showing the system itself doesn't favor short entries at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is massive and overrides other concerns. While the short score is low and we're in an absorption zone with minimal range, the H1 BEAR alignment for this SHORT trade gives us significant statistical advantage. The recent volume spike at 11:32 with strong delta suggests institutional activity that could support the move.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: H1 structure is BEAR which aligns with the SHORT direction, and the spread has turned negative (-0.25) indicating bearish momentum. While recent delta shows some buying pressure (bars -4 to -1), the overall structure supports the short entry, and the last bar shows decent range (0.14%) suggesting the market is moving rather than absorbing. The system's pre-qualification at a high-volume node combined with supportive higher timeframe structure outweighs the recent delta divergence.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp, being perfectly aligned with the SHORT direction. While the short score is low and we're in a minor absorption zone with limited range, the SMA spread alignment provides additional support. The H1 alignment alone creates substantial positive expectancy above our baseline.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: H1 structure is BEAR which supports the SHORT direction, and recent bars show decent volatility (0.09-0.14% range). While delta has turned positive in the last few bars indicating some buying pressure, this could represent a pullback into the high-volume node resistance zone that the system identified, making it a reasonable SHORT entry point at $671.19.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp) being aligned BEAR for SHORT, multiple critical factors are unfavorable. The average range of 0.082% falls well below the 0.12% threshold that shows +13.5pp edge improvement, suggesting we're in an absorption zone that should be skipped. The consistently low short scores (0-1 range) over recent bars indicate weak bearish momentum, contradicting the directional bias needed for this SHORT trade.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish absorption and rejection of lower levels. After the initial selling from bars -15 to -9, the market has been grinding higher with consistently positive delta in the final 3 bars (+1,026, +23,839, +38,856), indicating strong buying interest at these levels. The narrow ranges (0.05-0.10%) combined with positive delta suggest buyers are absorbing supply, making this a poor location for a short entry despite the system qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp, this setup sits in the absorption zone with average range of only 0.066% (well below the 0.12% threshold), indicating limited price movement potential. The consistently low short scores (0-1 across all recent bars) combined with narrow ranges suggest weak bearish momentum, which contradicts the premise of a successful short entry despite structural alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear warning signs against this SHORT entry. Despite H1 being BEAR, the recent bars (-2, -1) show strong buying pressure with positive delta (+23,839, +38,856) and price moving higher from 671.10 to 671.56. The Short scores are consistently 0-1 (well below the 4 threshold), and we're seeing absorption patterns with narrow ranges but increasing buying interest, suggesting potential upward momentum rather than the selling pressure needed for a successful short.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite the powerful H1 structure alignment (+36pp edge), this setup has clear red flags that override the positive signal. The average range of 0.067% puts us in the absorption zone where the backtesting specifically recommends to SKIP, and the consistently low short scores (all 0s and 1s) indicate very weak momentum confirmation. The combination of absorption-level price action with minimal directional conviction suggests this breakout lacks the follow-through needed for our 1.5R target.

The M5 timeframe has flipped to BEAR, and despite the positive spread, the consistent negative delta flow suggests the system's short signal aligns with emerging selling pressure at this resistance level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 alignment providing our strongest edge, this setup shows clear red flags - we're in an absorption zone with low range% (0.11% < 0.12% threshold), extremely low short scores indicating weak bearish momentum, and an opposed SMA spread that's widening bullishly against our short direction. The combination of absorption conditions and opposing momentum indicators overrides the structural alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure check shows H1 BEAR which supports the SHORT direction, and we're seeing consistent negative delta in the final 4 bars (-19,107 to -55,739) indicating building selling pressure. While the Short scores are low (0-1), the multi-timeframe structure has M5 flipping to BEAR in the last 2 bars, and the recent bars show adequate range (0.08-0.20%) indicating the market is moving rather than absorbing. The selling pressure buildup with supportive higher timeframe structure provides reasonable confirmation for the system's SHORT entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp, being perfectly aligned BEAR for this SHORT trade. While the short score is low and we're in a slight absorption zone with opposed SMA spread, the H1 alignment alone provides massive positive expectancy that far outweighs these concerns. The recent volume delta shows increasing selling pressure (-55k on last bar), supporting the SHORT direction despite mixed signals.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish momentum with consistently positive delta from bars -12 through -1 (ranging from +69,887 to +201,829), indicating strong buying pressure rather than selling pressure needed for a SHORT. The multi-timeframe structure shows H1 BULL which directly opposes the SHORT direction, and the spread has been persistently positive (+0.85 to +1.20) indicating bullish momentum. The Short scores are extremely low (mostly 2-4) while we're entering at what appears to be a momentum high after a clear bullish move from 330.82 to 333.49.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT direction), eliminating our most powerful +36pp edge and creating headwind. The short score is extremely low at 1.6, and SMA spread is strongly positive (+1.18), both opposing the SHORT direction. While range is adequate, the convergence of opposed H1 structure, weak short signals, and contrary momentum creates an unfavorable risk profile that falls well below our systematic edge requirements.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear opposition to this SHORT setup. All timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) are bullish, creating strong structural headwinds. Most critically, the final two bars (-2, -1) show massive selling volume (Delta: -19,107 and -65,080) but price is holding firm around 671.43-671.68, indicating strong absorption of selling pressure by buyers. The Short scores are consistently weak (1-4 range) throughout the sequence, confirming lack of bearish momentum despite the heavy selling flow.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has clear red flags across multiple key edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), short score is very low at 2.4, and SMA spread is strongly positive (+0.62%) opposing the short direction. While range% meets the threshold, the confluence of negative factors significantly reduces win probability below our acceptable threshold.

The H1 timeframe is BULL which directly opposes this SHORT entry, and the Short scores are extremely weak (mostly 2-4 range) while showing no deterioration in buying interest. This represents strong structural opposition to the SHORT direction.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT - H1 is BEAR but M15/M5/M1 are all BULL, creating conflicting signals. More critically, the delta pattern shows persistent buying pressure (+60K, +46K, +12K, +16K, +24K) through most bars, with only the final two bars showing selling (-19K, -65K). The spread is consistently positive (+0.62 at entry), and Short scores remain weak (never exceeding 4), indicating insufficient bearish conviction despite the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup violates our strongest edge with H1 structure being BEAR while we're shorting (we need H1 BEAR for shorts to align). Additionally, the short score is very low at 2.2 and SMA spread is opposed to our direction. While range% meets our threshold, the combination of opposed H1 structure (our +36pp edge working against us) plus low momentum signals and opposed SMA spread creates multiple unfavorable factors that clearly outweigh the single positive indicator.

Most critically, the dominant delta pattern shows persistent buying pressure (+60,692 at bar -11, +28,049 at bar -4) with Short scores consistently weak (0-4 range), while the spread has turned positive (+0.58), indicating bullish momentum acceleration into the entry zone.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge with H1 structure aligned (+36pp), multiple critical factors are working against us. The average range of 0.084% puts us in the absorption zone where we should skip trades, and the consistently low short scores (averaging 1.4) indicate weak bearish momentum. The opposing SMA spread further undermines the setup quality.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish momentum building into the entry, with consistent positive delta from bars -10 through -2 (+23k to +60k), indicating strong buying pressure. The multi-timeframe structure is predominantly bullish (M15/M5/M1 all BULL), and the short scores are extremely low (0-4 range) with recent bars showing only 1-2 short score.

  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple red flags converging - the H1 structure is opposed to our SHORT direction (losing our strongest +36pp edge), the short score is very low at 2.4, average range is below the 0.12% threshold indicating absorption zone conditions, and the SMA spread is opposed. With our strongest edge working against us and all supporting indicators unfavorable, this represents a clearly bad setup that should be avoided.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish momentum building into the entry, with strong buying pressure evident in bars -6 through -1 (delta values of +23,151, +29,876, +45,165, +32,708, +60,692, +46,789). The Short scores are extremely low (0-3 range) while Long scores are building to 2-3, and critically, the spread has turned positive (+0.02) on bar -1, indicating short-term momentum has shifted bullish right at the entry point.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup violates our strongest edge - H1 structure shows BEAR which actually ALIGNS with our SHORT direction (my initial read was incorrect), but the short scores are extremely low (averaging 1.4 vs favorable >=5), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.10% (below 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is opposed.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish momentum building into the entry, with strong positive delta readings (+60,692 and +46,789 on bars -2 and -1) indicating heavy buying pressure. The spread has improved from -0.75 to +0.02, showing momentum shifting bullish, and Short scores are consistently low (0-3 range) with recent Long scores strengthening to 2-3. This contradicts the SHORT direction despite the system's pre-qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (our +36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with low range%, and the short score is very weak at 1.8.

Additionally, the Long scores are extremely weak (0 throughout most bars, never exceeding 1), while Short scores are consistently higher (1-3 range). Despite positive delta showing buying pressure, the multi-timeframe structure and directional scores present strong opposition to a long position.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has three major red flags against it. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with very low range (0.034% vs needed 0.12%), and the long score is extremely weak at only 2.0.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the recent price action shows consistent negative delta with the stock failing to hold above the 168 level. Bar -1 shows massive volume (137K) with negative delta (-22,079) right before entry, suggesting strong selling pressure that could overwhelm any bounce attempt from this level.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and this has been consistent across all 15 bars leading up to entry. The Long scores are extremely weak (mostly 0-1, never above 2) while Short scores show some strength in recent bars (2 at entry). Additionally, there's clear selling pressure with significant negative deltas in key bars (-84,362 at bar -5, -42,767 at bar -14) and the spread remains consistently negative (-0.13), indicating bearish momentum that contradicts the LONG direction.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear unfavorable factors working against it. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), the long score is extremely low at 0.4, and SMA spread is also opposed with narrowing momentum. While the range is adequate at 0.13%, the combination of our strongest edge being negative plus weak momentum signals creates a clearly unfavorable setup that falls below our trading threshold.

While the final bar shows some selling with decent range (0.20%), the overall price action from 10:39-10:41 demonstrates aggressive buying that conflicts with the SHORT direction.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (our strongest +36pp edge working against us), the short score is weak at 3.2, and the SMA spread is positive/widening which opposes the SHORT direction.

  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that override the pre-qualification. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), the short score is consistently LOW across all recent bars, and the SMA spread is also opposed to the trade direction.

While H1 is BULL and M5 is BULL which supports the long direction, the recent bars show decent range% (0.03-0.04%) indicating the market is moving rather than absorbing. The long scores have improved to 1-3 in recent bars, and the positive delta trend suggests buyers are stepping in at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 Structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, significantly outweighing the negative factors. While the low range suggests absorption and SMA spread is opposed, the H1 bull alignment in a PRIMARY zone gives us strong positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) are strongly BULL, creating direct structural opposition to this SHORT entry. The Short scores are consistently weak (1-3 range) with the final bar showing only S=1, well below the favorable threshold. Despite adequate volatility, the overwhelmingly bullish structure and poor directional scores present clear evidence against this setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (H1 Structure +36pp) is working directly against this SHORT trade with BULL structure. Combined with weak short scores (avg 2.2) and bullish SMA spread alignment, multiple key indicators oppose the trade direction. While range is adequate, the primary structural edge that drives our best performance is clearly unfavorable.

  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) show consistent BULL structure, which directly opposes this SHORT entry. The delta pattern shows persistent buying pressure throughout most bars (+416k, +271k, +360k, +220k), with only the final bar showing modest selling (-62k). Short scores remain extremely low (1-3 range) with the spread consistently positive (+0.77 to +0.61), indicating the trend momentum is clearly against this short setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows clear opposition from our strongest edge - H1 structure is BULL while we're attempting a SHORT, which historically reduces win rate by 36pp from our baseline. Additionally, the short score is very low at 2.2, and SMA spread is also opposed to our direction. With multiple key indicators aligned against this trade and our strongest statistical edge clearly unfavorable, this represents one of those "clearly bad" setups that should be rejected despite the pre-qualification.

  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (MEDIUM) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All timeframe structures (H1, M15, M5, M1) are uniformly BULL, creating strong headwinds for a SHORT entry. The delta shows persistent buying pressure throughout the 15-bar sequence, with positive values ranging from +25K to +470K, indicating aggressive buying rather than selling pressure. The Short scores are consistently low (2-5 range) with no bars showing favorable SHORT conditions (score >=6), while this appears to be a continuation of bullish momentum rather than a reversal setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has our strongest negative edge - H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (BULL vs BEAR needed), which historically reduces win rates significantly. Additionally, the short score is consistently LOW across recent bars, providing no supporting momentum. While range is adequate, the combination of opposed structure and weak momentum signals creates unfavorable conditions that override the baseline positive expectancy.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]

  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT - H1 is BEAR but M15/M5/M1 have all flipped to BULL in recent bars, indicating bullish momentum on lower timeframes. The delta shows persistent buying pressure with positive values throughout most bars (+93k, +97k, +60k), and the Short scores are consistently weak (mostly 1-2, never reaching 4). The spread is positive (+0.82) and price action shows continued buying absorption rather than selling pressure needed for a SHORT entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure perfectly aligned for this SHORT setup. While the short score is low and we're in an absorption zone with limited range, the H1 alignment is our most powerful predictor and this is a pre-qualified PRIMARY zone setup. The opposed SMA spread creates some headwind, but the dominant H1 edge combined with our positive baseline expectancy supports taking this trade.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT entry with H1/M15/M1 all showing BULL alignment, and M5 just flipped from BEAR to BULL in the last 3 bars. The spread remains positive at +0.82, indicating upward momentum, while Short scores are extremely weak at only 1-3 throughout the sequence. Despite some selling pressure in bars -8 to -4, the recent bars show renewed buying with positive deltas and the trend structure completely favors longs over shorts.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Multiple RED FLAGS align against this short setup. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest +36pp edge works against us), we're in an absorption zone with low range% that backtesting says to skip, and the short score is weak at only 2.0. When our best edge is opposed AND we're in a skip zone, this becomes a clearly unfavorable setup despite the positive baseline expectancy.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All timeframes show strong BULL structure (H1/M15/M5/M1 all BULL), with consistent positive delta throughout the 15-bar sequence indicating persistent buying pressure. The spread remains positive (+0.65 at entry), Short scores are consistently low (2-3 range), and there's no evidence of selling pressure or structural weakness to support a SHORT entry at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple red flags stacked against it. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to our SHORT direction), which eliminates our strongest +36pp edge and creates headwind. The short score is very low at 2.8, indicating weak bearish momentum. Additionally, the SMA spread is narrowing and positive, showing bulls are still in control of the trend structure, directly opposing our short bias.

  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (MEDIUM) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows strong opposing signals for a SHORT entry. From bars -8 through -2, there's persistent positive delta (+21K to +43K) indicating sustained buying pressure, which directly contradicts a short setup. Additionally, the Short scores remain at 0 throughout most bars while Long scores are consistently 1, and the recent volatility is quite low (Range% mostly 0.02-0.07%) suggesting potential absorption rather than directional movement down.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: ** While H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp), the extremely low average range of 0.046% places this firmly in the absorption zone where our backtested data shows we should skip trades. The range is less than half our 0.12% threshold, indicating minimal movement potential. Even with H1 alignment and SMA spread supporting the SHORT direction, the lack of meaningful price movement creates unfavorable risk/reward dynamics that override the structural advantages.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish absorption against this SHORT setup. From bars -5 through -1, we see consistently strong positive delta (+21K to +43K) with very low volatility (Range% mostly 0.02-0.04%), indicating buyers are absorbing selling pressure at this level. The H1 structure is BEAR but all lower timeframes (M15/M5/M1) are BULL, and Short scores remain at 0-1 throughout the sequence, showing no bearish momentum developing despite the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup violates our strongest edge with H1 structure opposed (-36pp impact), combined with very low range% indicating absorption zone conditions where we should skip trades. While SMA spread is aligned, the combination of our most powerful negative indicator plus absorption zone conditions creates clearly unfavorable risk/reward despite the system pre-qualification.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish momentum building against this SHORT entry.

Additionally, the M1 structure has flipped from BEAR to BULL in recent bars, and the Short score has increased to 4 while Long score remains elevated, suggesting the market is pushing higher rather than setting up for a reversal.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest +36pp edge working against us), short score is very low at 2.8, and SMA spread is positive (wrong direction for SHORT). While range is adequate, the momentum data shows strong bullish delta in recent bars (+97,588, +93,091) and narrowing spreads turning positive, indicating upward pressure against our short thesis.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear warning signs against this SHORT entry. The final two bars (-2 and -1) display strong positive delta (+21,712 and +43,108) with increasing volume, indicating aggressive buying pressure right at the entry level. Additionally, the Short scores remain at 0 throughout while we see intermittent Long scores of 1, suggesting the M1 momentum is actually favoring the opposite direction of this SHORT setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 alignment providing our strongest edge, this setup is in a clear absorption zone with average range of only 0.04% - well below the 0.12% threshold where we should skip trades. The extremely low short score of 2.4 and consistent volume delta misalignment (positive delta on 4 of last 5 bars for a SHORT) indicate buyers are present and price lacks the momentum needed for our 1.5R target.

H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest +36pp edge working against us), short score is very LOW at 2.8, and SMA spread is OPPOSED with strong positive momentum (+1.24 and narrowing from wide to narrow suggests bullish pressure).

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which aligns with the SHORT direction, and the spread has been consistently negative (-0.16 to -0.47) throughout the sequence, supporting bearish momentum. While recent bars show mixed delta (bar -1 had positive delta of +21,712), the overall structure and negative spread provide sufficient support for the pre-qualified system entry. The range percentages are modest but not showing clear absorption patterns that would contradict the setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is perfectly aligned BEAR for our SHORT direction, giving us the strongest edge (+36pp improvement over baseline). While the short score is low and we're in an absorption zone with narrow ranges, the H1 alignment is so powerful it overrides these concerns. The SMA spread is also aligned and narrowing, which provides additional support for the SHORT direction.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which supports the SHORT direction, and the spread has been consistently negative throughout the entire sequence, indicating bearish momentum. While the M15/M5/M1 structures show BULL, this creates a counter-trend setup which can be profitable. The final bar (-1) shows positive delta (+21,712) which is concerning for a short entry, but the overall structural alignment and negative spread provide adequate support for the system's pre-qualified setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp, being perfectly aligned BEAR for this SHORT trade. While the short score is low and we're in an absorption zone with minimal range, the H1 alignment is so powerful it overcomes these weaker factors. The SMA spread alignment provides additional support, and our baseline 47% win rate already gives positive expectancy even without perfect conditions.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The setup shows consistent negative delta throughout most bars (-63K to -121K), indicating sustained selling pressure that supports the SHORT direction. While H1 structure is BEAR-favorable and spread is consistently negative (-0.20 to -0.47), the recent bars show some consolidation around the entry level with mixed small positive deltas on bars -9, -7, and -6. However, the overall selling pressure and structural alignment outweigh these minor bullish divergences, making this a reasonable SHORT entry to let the system work.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 Structure alignment +36pp), this setup shows concerning weakness with very low short scores (avg 1.0) indicating minimal selling pressure, and we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.05% which historically underperforms. The combination of low momentum signals and absorption zone conditions outweigh the structural alignment advantage in this secondary zone setup.

The final bar (-1) shows increased volume (29,470) with strong negative delta (-30,376) and decent range (0.07%), suggesting momentum building into the entry. While the M15 remains BULL creating some cross-current risk, the immediate M1 price action supports the SHORT with the recent drop from 489.31 to 489.02.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 structure alignment +36pp), this setup falls into the absorption zone with average range of only 0.05% - well below the 0.12% threshold where we see +13.5pp edge improvement. The extremely low short score (0.4) indicates minimal conviction in recent price action, and the backtested guidance specifically says to "SKIP if Absorption Zone (<0.12%)."

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong selling pressure with -612K delta and 0.09% range, indicating real movement rather than absorption. While H1 remains BULL (against our SHORT), the M15/M5/M1 timeframes have aligned bearish, and the dramatic shift from positive to negative delta in recent bars (starting bar -8) suggests momentum is turning.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong selling pressure with -612k delta and 0.09% range, indicating genuine downward movement rather than absorption. While H1 remains BULL (headwind), the M1 structure flipped to BULL for shorts and the short score improved to 2, suggesting the system caught a potential inflection point. The entry at 694.74 aligns well with the selling pressure seen in that high-volume breakout bar.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows clear unfavorable conditions across all major edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with very low range (missing the +13-16pp range edge), and the short score is extremely weak at 1.4. The recent bars show narrowing spreads and mixed momentum, creating a setup that lacks the movement and structural alignment needed for success.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish momentum with consistently negative delta from bars -8 through -1, indicating strong selling pressure. The entry at $489.92 is attempting to catch a falling knife as price has declined from $490.80 to $489.80, and the most recent bars (-3 to -1) show heavy selling with deltas of -65,469, -56,888, and -63,516 respectively. Additionally, the spread has turned increasingly negative (-0.16 to -0.22), confirming the downward momentum, making this an unfavorable entry despite the system's pre-qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags - H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (removing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range (0.046% << 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed. The consistent negative delta flow and low long scores across all recent bars indicate strong selling pressure that contradicts our bullish position.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with consistent negative delta from bars -9 through -1, indicating sustained selling pressure averaging -60K per bar. The momentum has shifted decisively bearish with prices declining from 490.80 to 489.80, and the spread has turned increasingly negative (-0.22 at entry), directly opposing the LONG direction. Most critically, H1 structure is BEAR while attempting a LONG entry, creating a direct structural conflict that violates the framework's guidance against trading when higher timeframes oppose the direction.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that override our pre-qualification. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.046% (well below the 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed.

The H1 timeframe is BEAR (opposing the LONG direction), Long scores are consistently 0-1 (well below favorable levels), and we're seeing a clear downtrend from 490.80 to the entry at 489.87. This represents strong structural opposition to a LONG entry.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish momentum with consistent negative delta across the last 10+ bars, indicating sustained selling pressure. The entry comes after a -0.35% decline from 490.80 to 489.85, with heavy selling volume (bars -6 to -1 show strong negative deltas of -80k+ and -65k). Most critically, H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the long scores remain at 0-1 throughout the recent action, showing no bullish conviction despite the system identifying this as a high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (missing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.044% vs 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed.

  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR throughout the entire 15-bar sequence, creating a strong headwind for this LONG entry. While the recent bars show positive delta and the Long scores have improved to 4, the consistent bearish higher timeframe structure and the fact that we're entering at $167.84 (near recent highs around $167.75) with opposing H1 momentum presents too much structural resistance for this long setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 structure being opposed (our strongest edge working against us), multiple supporting factors are present: good average range of 0.19% indicating sufficient movement, SMA spread strongly aligned with long direction at +0.456, and medium long score of 4.0. The recent positive volume delta momentum (+177k to +284k) and price action moving from 167.41 to 167.84 suggests bullish pressure building despite the H1 headwind.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which supports the LONG direction, and recent bars show adequate volatility (0.15-0.29% range) indicating the market is moving rather than absorbing. While delta turned slightly negative on the last bar (-24,118), the overall pattern shows buying pressure in preceding bars, and the long scores remain supportive at 3. No clear structural opposition or absorption patterns that would override the system's pre-qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which alone makes this trade favorable. While the long score is low, the aligned SMA spread and adequate range provide additional support. Even with mixed momentum signals, the H1 alignment combined with SECONDARY zone performance (59.82% mid-range win rate) creates positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

While the M15 remains BULL creating some cross-current, the recent price action shows rejection from the 672+ highs with increasing volatility (bar -1 at 0.29% range), indicating the high-volume node resistance may be holding.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which aligns with the SHORT direction, and we see clear selling pressure in the final two bars (-70,015 and -117,119 delta) with decent volatility (0.12% and 0.29% range). While the spread is still positive at +1.35, the recent momentum shift from buying pressure (bars -8 to -4) to strong selling pressure (bars -2 to -1) supports the system's SHORT signal at this high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is perfectly aligned (BEAR for SHORT), giving us our strongest +36pp edge which significantly outweighs other concerns. While the short score is low and SMA spread is opposed, the range is adequate at 0.17%, and we see increasing selling pressure in the final bars (-70k and -117k delta).

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which aligns with the SHORT direction, and we're seeing developing selling pressure with negative delta in the final two bars (-70,015 and -117,119). While the spread is still positive at +1.35, the recent price action shows a pullback from 672.28 to 669.98, and the Short scores are reasonable (3-5 range).

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear opposing signals for a SHORT entry. Despite H1 being BEAR, the recent bars (-6 to -3) show strong buying pressure with positive deltas (+102,384, +61,278, +61,202) pushing price higher from 669.68 to 671.96. Most critically, the Short scores are extremely weak (0-2 range in recent bars) while Long scores are stronger, and the final bar shows significant selling delta (-70,015) that appears to be absorption after the buying wave, suggesting institutional support at these levels.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While we have our strongest edge with H1 structure aligned (+36pp), multiple other factors are clearly unfavorable - we're in an absorption zone with low range, short scores are very weak, and the SMA spread is opposed to our direction. The combination of low movement environment and weak momentum signals suggests this setup lacks the follow-through potential needed despite the structural alignment.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which aligns with the SHORT direction, and we see clear selling pressure emerging in the final bar (-1) with strong negative delta of -70,015 and declining price action from the 672.28 high. While the Short scores are relatively low (1-2 range recently), the structural alignment and the shift from consistent buying pressure to strong selling pressure in bar -1 supports the system's SHORT entry at this high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite having our strongest edge (H1 structure aligned +36pp), multiple unfavorable factors stack against this trade. The average range of 0.11% falls into the absorption zone where we should skip trades, and the consistently low short scores (1-2) in recent bars suggest weak bearish conviction. The opposed SMA spread further reduces our edge, creating a setup where even with H1 alignment, the probability of success is significantly compromised.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: Structure is supportive with H1 BEAR alignment for the SHORT direction. The last bar (-1) shows strong selling pressure with -70,015 delta and declining price action from the 672+ highs, suggesting momentum is turning bearish into the entry. While Short scores are low (1-2 recent bars), the negative delta emergence and price rejection from higher levels support the systematic entry at this high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp), the setup has two critical weaknesses: extremely low short scores (averaging 1.2) indicate weak bearish momentum, and the average range of 0.096% falls into the absorption zone where we should skip trades per the backtested rules.

  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp), this setup has multiple red flags that compound negatively. The average range of 0.106% puts us in the absorption zone where we should SKIP, short scores are extremely weak (1.2 vs needed 5+), and the widening bullish SMA spread directly opposes our SHORT direction.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent strong buying pressure with positive delta on nearly every bar (-15 through -1), including significant spikes of +107K, +110K, +142K, and +145K delta. Additionally, the spread has been steadily improving from -2.73 to +1.18, indicating strengthening bullish momentum. The recent move from 667.78 to 671.91 with persistent buying pressure directly contradicts the SHORT setup at this high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that override the baseline expectancy. The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (our strongest +36pp edge working against us), the short score is very low at 2.2, and the SMA spread is positive and narrowing which opposes the short bias. Only the range criteria is favorable, but this single factor cannot overcome the confluence of negative indicators from our most reliable edges.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows persistent buying pressure with positive delta on nearly every bar (-15 through -1), indicating strong absorption of selling interest. The recent move from 667.78 to 671.91 (+4.13 points) demonstrates bullish momentum despite the bearish H1 structure, and the Short scores are consistently weak (0-5 range) with several bars showing stronger Long scores. This suggests the market is finding buyers at these levels rather than sellers, making a SHORT entry at 671.43 poorly positioned against the immediate buying pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 BEAR structure perfectly aligned for this SHORT trade. While the short score is low and SMA spread is opposed, the dominant H1 alignment combined with good range movement (0.18% average) provides sufficient edge above our baseline. The recent narrowing spread from -2.73 to +1.18 shows potential momentum shift that could favor the short direction.

Range% shows good movement potential above the 0.12% threshold, and SMA spread is aligned. While the Long Score is low, the H1 alignment is our most powerful predictor and the setup meets movement criteria, making this a statistically favorable trade despite the mediocre momentum reading.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bullish momentum building into the entry, with strongly positive delta on the last 4 bars (+155K, +88K, +180K, +289K) and an improving spread from -0.01 to +0.20. The H1 structure is BULL (against our SHORT), and the short scores are consistently weak (0-2) while long scores strengthen to 2 in recent bars, indicating this is fighting the dominant flow.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT direction), eliminating our +36pp edge advantage. The average range of 0.034% is well below the 0.12% absorption zone threshold, indicating weak movement. Additionally, the short score of 1.0 is very low and SMA spread is opposed, providing no supporting confirmation for the short bias.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1/M15/M5 structure remains supportive (BULL) for the long entry, and delta has turned consistently positive from bar -9 onwards, showing sustained buying pressure into the entry. While the spread is still negative (-0.21), it has been steadily improving from -0.61 to +0.21 over the last 15 bars, indicating potential momentum shift in favor of longs. The recent bars show decent volume with positive delta, supporting the systematic entry at this high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure perfectly aligned for LONG. While the low range% and poor long scores are concerning, the SMA spread alignment provides additional support. Even with weaker supporting indicators, the dominant H1 alignment edge combined with our positive baseline expectancy makes this a statistically favorable trade.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is supportive with H1/M15/M5 all BULL, and recent bars show positive delta indicating buying pressure (bars -4 through -1 all positive). While M1 flipped to BEAR on the last bar, the Long score remains at 4 and volatility is adequate at 0.28%. The spread is improving toward positive territory (+0.49), suggesting the shorter-term momentum is aligning with the bullish higher timeframe structure.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and we see a clear shift from negative delta (bars -15 to -11) to consistently positive delta (bars -10 to -1), indicating buying pressure has taken control. The spread has improved from -0.61 to +0.21, showing momentum building in our favor, though the low range percentages (mostly <0.10%) suggest some absorption that keeps confidence at medium rather than high.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is present with H1 structure aligned BULL for this LONG trade. While the low range% (0.052%) and low long score (1.0) are concerning, the dominant H1 alignment edge significantly outweighs these negatives.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which supports the LONG direction, and recent bars show decent volatility (0.38% range on bar -1). While there's been consistent negative delta and selling pressure in recent bars, the entry comes after a pullback to the $327.80 area with some buying emerging (bar -1 shows +35,744 delta), suggesting potential support at this level for the system-identified high-volume node.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge (+36pp), which is the most critical factor for success. While the low long scores and opposed SMA spread are concerning, the sufficient range activity and our pre-qualified SECONDARY zone status support execution. The H1 alignment alone makes this statistically favorable despite mixed supporting indicators.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All higher timeframes (H1/M15/M5/M1) are strongly BULL, creating significant structural headwind for a SHORT entry. The recent bars (-3 to -1) show positive delta indicating buying pressure emergence, with delta flipping from negative to positive (+147,669, +48,464, +43,828). Additionally, the Short score is only 3, which is below the favorable threshold of 4, while the Long score remains at 3-4, suggesting the system sees limited edge for shorting at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has our strongest negative edge - H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (BULL vs BEAR needed), which historically reduces win rates significantly. Additionally, the short score is consistently LOW (<4) across recent bars, indicating weak bearish momentum. While SMA spread is aligned and range is adequate, the combination of opposed H1 structure and weak short scores creates multiple unfavorable factors that override the positive expectancy.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT - all timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) show BULL structure with the lower timeframes flipping to BULL in the last 3 bars. The Short scores are extremely weak (0-2 range) while Long scores are strengthening. Most critically, the recent bars show positive delta (+89K, +130K, +100K, +171K) indicating sustained buying pressure right into the entry, which directly opposes the SHORT thesis.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (our strongest +36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with avg range <0.12%, and the short score is extremely low at 1.0.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT entry with H1/M15/M5 all showing BULL, and M1 recently flipped from BEAR to BULL in the last 3 bars. The delta pattern shows persistent buying pressure in recent bars (+89,371, +130,298, +100,382, +171,140) after the selling pressure from bars -10 to -6, and the Short score is extremely weak at only 1. This represents clear structural opposition to the SHORT direction.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple major red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (BULL vs SHORT direction), which eliminates our +36pp edge and creates headwind. The average range of 0.089% is well below the 0.12% absorption threshold, indicating low movement potential.

  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that override our baseline edge. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), short score is extremely weak at 1.0, and we're in an absorption zone with sub-0.12% range.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) are strongly BULL, creating direct structural opposition to this SHORT entry. The short score is consistently weak at only 3, well below favorable levels. Most critically, the delta pattern shows strong selling pressure from 09:30-09:40 (all negative deltas ranging from -17K to -907K) but bar -1 shows a significant shift to +147K buying delta, suggesting potential absorption and reversal of the selling momentum right before entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (H1 Structure +36pp) is directly opposed - we're shorting into a BULL H1 structure, which historically reduces win rates significantly. While we have decent range (0.45%) and aligned SMA spread, the H1 opposition combined with consistently negative volume delta throughout the decline suggests this move may be overdone and due for bounce.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All timeframes (H1, M15, M5, M1) are strongly BULL with Short scores consistently at only 3, well below the favorable threshold of 4+. More critically, the price action shows a clear reversal pattern - after sustained selling pressure (negative delta) driving price from 252+ down to 248 lows, bars -2 and -1 show dramatic shifts with delta moving from -17K to +147K, indicating strong buying absorption at these levels right before the short entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which is directly opposed to our SHORT direction - this removes our strongest edge (-36pp impact).

  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction, which represents our strongest negative edge (-36pp).

  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite H1 structure opposition (our strongest edge), the setup shows positive elements with good range activity (0.32% avg) and aligned SMA spread providing directional support.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure check passes with H1 BEAR supporting the SHORT direction, and the Short score of 3 is borderline acceptable. Most importantly, the last bar (-1) shows a strong volume spike to 188,914 with wide range (0.51%) and negative spread (-0.65), suggesting institutional selling pressure right at the entry zone. While delta has been improving (becoming less negative), the combination of bearish structure and the volume/range expansion on the final bar supports the system's identification of this high-volume-node entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup hits our strongest edge with H1 structure perfectly aligned for SHORT (+36pp boost), supported by excellent range above 0.12% threshold (+13-16pp edge) and aligned SMA spread. The consistent high volume and range in recent bars shows active price discovery rather than absorption, creating favorable conditions for our SHORT entry.

  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5) are strongly BULL, creating significant structural headwinds for a SHORT entry. The Short score has deteriorated from 2 to just 1 in the final bar, while momentum is building upward with the largest volume spike at bar -1 (254,985) showing renewed buying interest after the pullback. Despite negative delta and spread favoring shorts, the overwhelming bullish structure across all timeframes presents too much opposition for this setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear unfavorable factors - H1 structure is OPPOSED to our SHORT direction (missing our strongest +36pp edge), short scores are extremely weak averaging only 0.8, and we're in an absorption zone with average range below the 0.12% threshold. Only the SMA spread alignment provides support, but it's insufficient to overcome the structural opposition and weak momentum signals.

  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: All higher timeframes (H1, M15, M5) are strongly BULL, directly opposing this SHORT entry. The Short score has deteriorated from 2 to 1 in recent bars, showing weakening bearish momentum. Despite negative delta in bars -6 through -1 indicating selling pressure, the bullish structure across all timeframes creates too much headwind for a SHORT position in a system that relies on structural alignment.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple red flags working against us. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with low range% (below the 0.12% threshold), and short score is extremely weak at 0.8. While SMA spread is aligned, it's insufficient to overcome the structural headwinds and lack of volatility expansion needed for this short entry.

  Entry: $489.94 | Model: EPCH4 | Zone: SECONDARY

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in the final two bars before entry, with strong negative delta (-17,027 and -33,122) indicating selling pressure right at the entry zone. Additionally, both Long scores dropped to 0 in bars -2 and -1, while the spread widened negatively, suggesting the system's high-volume node may be absorbing buying interest rather than providing support. The entry at $489.94 occurs right after this selling pressure, making it a poor risk/reward setup despite the system qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple strong red flags: H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (major negative edge), we're in the absorption zone with avg range <0.12% (skip rule applies), SMA spread is also opposed, and long score is extremely low at 0.4. Despite our positive baseline expectancy, the combination of our strongest edge working against us plus absorption zone conditions creates clearly unfavorable risk/reward.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is strongly against this SHORT - H1/M15/M5 are all BULL while only M1 is BEAR, creating significant multi-timeframe conflict. The Short score is extremely weak at 0-1 throughout most bars, never reaching the minimum threshold of 4. Additionally, the recent price action shows a clear bounce from 627.40 low back to 628.13 with negative delta failing to push price lower, suggesting buyers are absorbing selling pressure at these levels.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT direction), which removes our +36pp edge and creates headwind. The average range of 0.084% falls into the absorption zone below our 0.12% threshold, historically showing poor performance. While SMA spread is aligned, the combination of opposed H1 structure and low movement/range creates unfavorable conditions that override the baseline expectancy.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and this bearish pressure has been consistent across all 15 bars leading to entry. Additionally, the final bar (09:39) shows clear deterioration with negative delta (-17,027), widening spread (-0.18), and Long/Short scores dropping to 0/0, indicating selling pressure is building right before the entry point. The price action from the opening spike at 09:30 (491.10) shows a clear rejection pattern declining toward the entry level at 489.92, suggesting this zone may act as resistance rather than support.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with range <0.12% (missing our +13.5pp range edge), and SMA spread is opposed with widening negative spread. The consistently low long scores (0-1) over recent bars confirm weak bullish momentum, making this a clearly unfavorable setup despite the pre-qualification.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Actual: WIN | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the consistent negative delta from -467K to -152K across bars -9 through -1 shows persistent selling pressure with no signs of buyers stepping in. The spread has deteriorated significantly from -0.05 to -0.53, indicating weakening momentum, and despite decent range percentages, the price action shows a clear downtrend from 239.85 to 238.34 without any meaningful bounce or accumulation pattern near the entry level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows clear opposition from our strongest edge - H1 structure is BEAR while we're going LONG, which historically reduces win rates by 36pp. Additionally, the SMA spread is strongly opposed at -0.384, and we're in a SECONDARY zone with lower base performance. While range is adequate, the combination of opposing H1 structure and negative SMA momentum creates multiple unfavorable factors that override the system's baseline edge.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: WIN | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 timeframe shows consistent BEAR structure throughout all 15 bars, which directly opposes this LONG entry. Additionally, the delta has been persistently negative from bars -9 through -1, showing sustained selling pressure of over 100k-600k per bar, indicating strong institutional selling. The spread is also deeply negative at -0.53, confirming bearish momentum, while the Long scores remain weak (mostly 0-1, max 4) compared to Short scores consistently at 3.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (BEAR vs LONG), which eliminates our strongest +36pp edge and creates headwind. Additionally, the SMA spread is also opposed with widening bearish momentum (-0.38 to -0.53), and we're seeing consistent negative delta flow with substantial selling pressure throughout the setup period. While range is adequate and long score is moderate, the alignment of multiple opposing factors (H1 structure + SMA spread + persistent negative delta) creates an unfavorable risk profile that overrides the system's baseline edge.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [+]
  Actual: WIN | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish pressure with consistently negative delta from bars -8 through -1, indicating persistent selling. The M15 timeframe has flipped to BEAR while we're attempting a LONG entry, and the spread has been deeply negative (-0.88 at entry), showing price well below moving average support. The Long scores are consistently low (3-5 range) while Short scores remain elevated (2-3), indicating the system recognizes unfavorable conditions for longs despite this being a pre-qualified entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (H1 Structure alignment) is clearly favorable, providing a +36pp boost to win rate. The average range of 0.27% shows good movement potential with another +13-16pp edge. While the SMA spread is opposed, the two strongest historical edges are aligned, and this SECONDARY zone setup maintains positive expectancy well above breakeven requirements.

  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [+]
  Actual: WIN | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with strong selling pressure in the final bars before entry. Bars -2 and -1 show massive negative delta (-909,649 and -649,170) indicating heavy absorption/selling at these levels, while the Long score has declined from 4 to 3. Additionally, the entry at $401.18 is occurring right after price broke down from the $406+ area with sustained selling pressure, suggesting this could be a failed bounce rather than a legitimate reversal.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is fully present with H1 structure aligned BULL for this LONG trade. Average range of 0.85% shows strong movement well above the 0.12% threshold for favorable conditions. While the SMA spread is opposed, the primary H1 alignment edge significantly outweighs this negative factor, and the system has already pre-qualified this SECONDARY zone setup.

  Actual: WIN | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with consistently negative delta on bars -2 and -1 (-909,649 and -649,170), indicating heavy selling pressure right before entry. Additionally, the M1 structure has turned BEAR with Long scores declining from 4 to 3, while the stock is making lower lows from 409.53 down to 400.67. This represents active selling absorption at a critical juncture, directly opposing the LONG thesis.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is the most critical factor. The excellent average range of 0.87% shows strong movement potential well above the 0.12% threshold. While the SMA spread is opposed, the combination of H1 alignment and strong range movement provides sufficient positive expectancy for this PRIMARY zone setup.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with strong selling pressure. The last 3 bars (-3 to -1) show massive negative delta (-909,649 and -649,170), indicating heavy selling absorption despite the system identifying this as a high-volume node. Additionally, the Long score has declined from 4 to 5 (worse for longs), and we're seeing consistent negative spread momentum (-0.21 to -0.70), suggesting the selling pressure is accelerating rather than being absorbed at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure ALIGNED for this LONG trade. Average range of 0.85% shows excellent movement well above the 0.12% threshold for favorable conditions. While SMA spread is opposed and long score is only medium, the H1 alignment provides such a significant statistical advantage that it outweighs these concerns, especially given our positive baseline expectancy.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish momentum with consistently negative delta from 09:28 onwards, including massive selling pressure at market open (-555K delta at 09:30) that has continued through entry time (-220K delta at 09:36). The M15 timeframe has flipped to BEAR structure, and despite system qualification, the immediate price action shows strong selling absorption with wide spreads and persistent negative delta, creating unfavorable conditions for a long entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure aligned bullish for this LONG trade. The average range of 0.30% is well above the 0.12% threshold providing the +13.5pp range edge. While the SMA spread is opposed and long scores are only medium, the combination of our two strongest edges (H1 alignment and good range) provides solid positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with consecutive negative delta readings on bars -2 (-909,649) and -1 (-649,170), indicating strong selling pressure right at the entry level. The M1 structure has flipped to BEAR with declining Long scores (5->3), and we're seeing a consistent downtrend from 409.53 to 400.67 over the past 7 bars despite the system identifying this as a high-volume node. The combination of heavy selling pressure and bearish M1 momentum directly opposes this LONG entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure fully aligned for this LONG trade. The excellent average range of 0.78% indicates strong movement potential, far exceeding the 0.12% threshold for the range edge. While the SMA spread is opposed, the combination of our most powerful structural edge plus strong range movement creates a high-probability setup that significantly exceeds our baseline expectancy.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows a clear rejection from the 676+ highs with strong selling pressure evident in bars -3 and -2 (delta of -89K and -130K respectively). While H1 remains BEAR and recent bars show adequate volatility (0.24-0.58% range), the short scores have been consistently at 4+ levels, supporting the systematic entry. The pullback in bar -1 appears to be a minor retracement before potential continuation lower.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup hits our strongest edge with H1 BEAR structure perfectly aligned for SHORT (+36pp improvement). The substantial average range of 0.34% shows real price movement, well above the 0.12% absorption threshold. While the short score is moderate and SMA spread is slightly opposed, the dominant H1 alignment combined with strong price movement creates a high-probability setup that significantly exceeds our baseline expectancy.
