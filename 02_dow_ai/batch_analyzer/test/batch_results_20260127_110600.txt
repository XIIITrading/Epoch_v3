  TSLA LONG | 2026-01-26 13:45:15
  Entry: $438.09 | Model: EPCH2 | Zone: PRIMARY

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 timeframe shows BEAR structure which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are consistently 0-1 (well below the 4 threshold) throughout the entire 15-bar sequence. Additionally, there's persistent negative delta on key bars (-76,789 at bar -9, -78,939 at bar -7, -81,368 at bar -6) indicating strong selling pressure, even though the final bar shows positive delta of +81,998 which could be a temporary bounce in an overall bearish context.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple strong negative factors aligned against it. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest edge at +36pp is working against us), we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.056% << 0.12% threshold), and the SMA spread is both wide and opposed to our long direction. The consistently low long scores (0-1) across recent bars confirm weak bullish sentiment, making this a clearly unfavorable setup despite the PRIMARY zone qualification.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are consistently 0-1 (well below the 4 threshold) throughout the entire 15-bar sequence. Additionally, there's persistent negative delta showing selling pressure, particularly the heavy -76,789 delta at bar -8 and -78,939 at bar -6, indicating strong absorption of buying attempts at these levels.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows clear unfavorable conditions across all major edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with average range well below 0.12% (missing the range edge entirely), and SMA spread is negative and widening against our direction. The combination of opposed H1 structure, low movement environment, and negative technical alignment creates a setup that falls well below our positive expectancy threshold.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows strong buying momentum from bars -6 through -1, with consistently positive delta values (especially +117,960 at bar -3 and +113,791 at bar -2) indicating sustained buying pressure. While H1 structure is BULL (supportive for LONG) and recent bars show adequate volatility (0.18% range), the Long scores remain relatively low (3-4 range) and we're entering against lower timeframe bearish structure. However, the volume surge and positive delta pattern suggests institutional buying interest that supports the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp above baseline, making this a solid setup despite the low long score. The average range of 0.15% indicates genuine movement above the absorption threshold, and aligned SMA spread adds supporting momentum. While momentum scores are modest, the primary structural edge strongly favors taking this trade.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish momentum with heavy selling pressure in the recent bars. Bars -6 through -3 show massive negative delta (-76,789, -78,939, -81,368) with increasing volume, indicating strong institutional selling. The H1 timeframe is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and both Long scores are extremely low (0-1 range) while Short scores are elevated, creating multiple structural headwinds against the setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags that stack against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.052% << 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed. The combination of opposed H1 structure, absorption zone conditions, and consistently low long scores creates a clearly unfavorable risk profile that warrants rejection.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: This is a clear fade setup against strong selling pressure. Bars -5 through -2 show massive negative delta (-76,789, -23,190, -78,939, -81,368) with increasing volume, indicating institutional selling absorption in this zone. The H1 BEAR structure combined with Long scores of 0-1 throughout and negative spread (-0.12) all align against this long entry at what appears to be a distribution level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags that override the pre-qualification. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with avg range <0.12% (backtesting shows to SKIP these), and SMA spread is also opposed with widening negative momentum. The combination of opposed H1 structure, absorption zone conditions, and low momentum scores creates a clearly unfavorable risk/reward scenario despite the PRIMARY zone qualification.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with strong selling pressure in the final bars before entry. Bars -4 through -1 show increasingly negative delta (-76,789, -23,190, -78,939, -81,368) with rising volume, indicating aggressive selling into this level. The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes the LONG direction, and the Long scores are extremely weak (0-1) throughout the entire sequence, showing no bullish conviction at this proposed entry point.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our biggest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with average range well below 0.12% threshold, and SMA spread is also opposed. The consistently low long scores (mostly 1s) in recent bars confirm weak bullish momentum, making this a clearly unfavorable setup despite the pre-qualification.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with heavy selling pressure in the final bars before entry. Bars -4 through -1 show massive negative delta (-76,789, -23,190, -78,939, -81,368) with accelerating volume, indicating strong institutional selling into this level. The H1 bearish structure combined with this absorption pattern suggests the high-volume node is being used as distribution rather than accumulation, making this a poor risk/reward setup despite the system qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags that override the system baseline. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with avg range of only 0.058% (well below the 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed. The consistently low long scores (all 1s) and recent heavy selling pressure with large negative deltas confirm unfavorable conditions for a long entry.

  Pass 1: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Pass 2: NO_TRADE  (HIGH) [+]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration with strong selling pressure in the final bars before entry. Bars -3, -2, and -1 all show significant negative delta (-76,789, -23,190, -78,939) with increasing volume, indicating aggressive selling into this zone. The H1 structure is BEAR across all timeframes, Long scores are extremely low (0-1), and price is breaking down from $438.69 resistance rather than showing any bullish reversal characteristics at the proposed $438.11 entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range (0.054% << 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed. The combination of opposed H1 structure, absorption zone conditions, and consistently low long scores (1-2 range) creates a clearly unfavorable setup that falls well below our quality threshold.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The massive volume spike at bar -2 (112,415 volume) with positive delta (+13,691) and strong range (0.39%) shows significant buying interest that lifted price from 390.27 to 391.43. Bar -1 continues with strong positive delta (+36,978) and decent volume (40,101), suggesting follow-through buying momentum into the entry level. While H1 structure remains BULL (supportive for LONG) and recent bars show adequate volatility above 0.10%, the consistently bearish lower timeframes (M15/M5/M1) and low Long scores (1-3) prevent higher confidence.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is enormous and overrides other concerns. The good range% (0.178%) indicates sufficient movement is present, meeting our candle range edge threshold. While the long score is low and SMA spread is opposed, the H1 alignment is so statistically powerful that it makes this trade favorable despite mixed supporting indicators.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong bullish momentum with massive volume spike (112,415 vs typical 10-20k), positive delta (+13,691), and significant range expansion (0.39%). While H1 structure remains BULL which supports the long direction, the M1 scores jumped from 0 to 4 on the entry bar, indicating emerging short-term bullish momentum that aligns with the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is fully present with H1 structure ALIGNED for this LONG trade. The average range of 0.15% meets the favorable movement threshold (+15.7pp edge). While the long score is low and SMA spread is opposed, the H1 alignment is our most powerful predictor and overrides these weaker negative signals in a pre-qualified SECONDARY zone setup.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong bullish momentum with massive volume (112,415) and positive delta (+13,691), creating a 0.39% range move that breaks above recent resistance around 391.24. While the H1 structure is BULL (supportive) and the long score jumps to 3, the opposing bearish alignment on lower timeframes (M15/M5/M1 all BEAR) creates some concern. However, the explosive volume and buying pressure on the entry bar suggests institutional participation that could override the lower timeframe bearish bias.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp being perfectly aligned with the LONG direction. The final bar shows explosive volume (112K vs ~20K average) with a strong 0.39% range and positive momentum after price compression. While the long score is low and SMA spread is opposed, the H1 alignment combined with clear breakout characteristics and good range movement outweigh the negatives for this pre-qualified SECONDARY zone setup.

  Actual: WIN | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows strong bullish momentum with persistent positive delta from bars -7 through -1, including extremely high buying pressure at bar -3 (+182,106 delta with 157k volume). The H1 structure is BEAR but all shorter timeframes (M15, M5, M1) are BULL, and the spread has turned positive (+0.44), indicating the bullish momentum is overriding the higher timeframe bearish structure. The Short scores are consistently low (1-3) while this appears to be an active bullish breakout rather than exhaustion.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is massive and overcomes other negative factors. While the low range suggests absorption and the SMA spread is opposed, the H1 alignment alone pushes this well above our breakeven threshold. The SECONDARY zone performance (47.31% mid-tier) combined with the H1 edge creates positive expectancy despite suboptimal supporting indicators.

  Actual: WIN | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear opposing structure with strong bullish momentum building into the entry. The last 5 bars (-5 to -1) show massive buying pressure with delta values of +64K, +100K, +95K, +84K, and +182K, accompanied by explosive volume (157K on bar -1 vs typical 15-40K range). The spread has turned positive (+0.31) and all lower timeframes (M15/M5/M1) are aligned BULL, indicating this is a momentum breakout against the SHORT direction rather than a reversal setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple strong red flags against our SHORT direction. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), the short score is weak at 3.2, and SMA spread is opposed showing bullish momentum. While we have adequate range, the confluence of negative factors significantly reduces win probability below our acceptable threshold.

  Pass 1: TRADE     (HIGH) [-]
  Pass 2: TRADE     (MEDIUM) [-]
  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action strongly supports this LONG entry. Starting from bar -12, we see a clear shift from negative delta (selling pressure) to increasingly positive delta, culminating in +82,949 delta on the entry bar. The structure is fully bullish across all timeframes (H1/M15/M5/M1), ranges show healthy movement (0.10%+ on most recent bars), and the momentum has clearly shifted bullish from bars -7 onwards with consistent positive delta and rising prices from the 325.94 low to the 327.40 entry level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly met with H1 structure aligned bullish for this long trade. Price action shows strong momentum with positive volume delta in recent bars (+82,949 on entry bar) and sufficient range for movement. While long scores are low, the primary H1 alignment edge combined with adequate range and improving volume delta provides positive expectancy above our baseline.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: ** While Long scores are weak, the strong positive delta sequence and bullish multi-timeframe structure support the system's entry. The recent buying pressure and price advancement provide enough technical support to let the pre-qualified system work, despite momentum indicator concerns.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (H1 Structure alignment) is clearly favorable, providing our best statistical advantage at +36pp above baseline. While the long score is low and SMA spread is opposed, the clear upward momentum in the last 3 bars with strong positive delta (+60k, +68k, +45k) and improving spread suggests building bullish pressure that aligns with our H1 structure edge.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows explosive volume (124K vs typical 10-20K) with strong positive delta (+78,502) and significant range (0.27%), indicating genuine buying interest at this level. While the M1 timeframe flipped to BEAR and spread remains negative, the H1 structure stays BULL which provides favorable higher timeframe context. The long score jumped to 4 on the entry bar, meeting the minimum threshold for continuation.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge at +36pp, which is the most critical factor. The average range of 0.14% exceeds our threshold for meaningful movement.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 timeframe is BEAR, which directly opposes this LONG entry, and all Long scores are 0-1 (well below the 4 threshold), indicating extremely weak long conditions. Additionally, most recent bars show negative delta values (bars -14, -13, -11, -10), suggesting selling pressure dominates, and the consistently narrow ranges (<0.10% except bar -11) indicate potential absorption rather than healthy price movement supporting a long position.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is consistently BEAR across all 15 bars, directly opposing this LONG entry. The Long scores are extremely weak (mostly 0-1, never above 1) while Short scores are consistently higher, indicating systematic bearish pressure. Additionally, the recent bars show mixed delta with significant selling pressure (bars -9, -8, -5, -2 all negative delta), and Range% values are mostly below 0.10% suggesting absorption rather than bullish momentum.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are consistently 0-1 (well below the 4 threshold) throughout the entire 15-bar sequence. Additionally, the recent bars show mixed to negative delta (-68,526 at bar -4, -88,835 at bar -3) indicating selling pressure into the entry zone, while Range% values are mostly below 0.10% suggesting absorption rather than breakout momentum.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (missing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with average range of only 0.078% (below our 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is opposed. The consistently low long scores (0-1 range) over recent bars further confirm unfavorable conditions across all our key indicators.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are consistently 0-1 (well below the 4 threshold) throughout the entire lookback period. Additionally, the recent bars show negative delta values (-68,526, -88,835, -3,300) indicating selling pressure rather than buying support at this level, creating multiple red flags against the long setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that stack against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest +36pp edge working against us), we're in the absorption zone with avg range of only 0.08% (below the 0.12% threshold for the +13.5pp range edge), and SMA spread is opposed with narrowing momentum. The combination of our strongest structural edge being negative plus absorption zone conditions creates a clearly unfavorable setup that falls well outside our positive expectancy parameters.

  Actual: LOSS | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear bearish momentum with consistent negative delta from bars -9 through -1, indicating sustained selling pressure right into the entry. Despite the H1 flipping to BULL at bar -1, the M1 structure remains BEAR with consistently low Long scores (0-2) throughout the sequence, and the spread is deeply negative at -0.17, showing bearish short-term momentum. This creates a direct conflict between the system's bullish signal and the immediate price action showing active selling pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure ALIGNED for this LONG trade. While the low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone and the opposed SMA spread is unfavorable, the H1 alignment provides such a significant statistical advantage that it overrides these concerns. The setup meets our positive expectancy threshold despite mixed supporting indicators.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure just flipped to BULL on the entry bar (-1), aligning with the LONG direction and showing potential momentum shift. While there was consistent negative delta from bars -9 to -1 indicating selling pressure, the final bar shows this pressure diminishing (-2,380 vs much larger negative values earlier). The range on the entry bar is 0.21%, well above the 0.10% threshold, indicating the market is moving rather than absorbing, which supports taking the systematic entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which alone makes this trade worthwhile despite the low momentum scores and narrow ranges. While the SMA spread is opposed and recent price action shows minimal movement, the H1 bull alignment on a pre-qualified SECONDARY zone setup maintains positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is consistently BEAR across all 15 bars, creating strong headwind against this LONG entry. The Long scores are extremely weak (0-1) throughout most of the sequence, only reaching 2 at maximum, which is well below the favorable threshold of 4+. Additionally, the persistent negative delta from bars -15 to -14 through -3 to -2 shows selling pressure, and while the entry bar shows positive delta, it's relatively weak at +14,673 despite high volume, suggesting potential absorption rather than genuine buying interest.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with very low range% (0.062% vs 0.12% threshold), and SMA spread is also opposed.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows a crucial shift with H1 and M15 both flipping to BULL structure, creating multi-timeframe alignment for the long entry. While the preceding bars show concerning negative delta indicating selling pressure, the entry bar demonstrates decent range (0.21%) suggesting the market is moving rather than absorbing. The system's pre-qualification at a high-volume node, combined with the structural improvement right at entry, supports taking this trade despite the recent selling pressure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure just flipped bullish providing our strongest edge (+36pp), multiple other factors are clearly unfavorable - we're in an absorption zone with low range% that backtesting suggests we should skip, consistently low long scores, and SMA spread opposing our direction. The H1 flip occurred right at entry suggesting potential false breakout rather than confirmed momentum.

The Long scores are extremely weak (0-1) across all bars except the final entry bar, indicating persistent selling pressure. While the last bar shows increased volume and a slight improvement in Long score to 2, the overwhelming structural and momentum evidence suggests this long entry is fighting against the dominant H1 bearish trend.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong bullish momentum with massive volume spike (121K vs ~25-40K average), positive delta (+66,272), and good range (0.37%), indicating institutional buying interest right at the entry zone. While M15 structure is BEAR, H1 remains BULL which provides higher timeframe support, and the recent narrowing spread pattern (bars -4 to -2) followed by the explosive move suggests accumulation before breakout.

While the long score is unfavorable, the combination of our most powerful edge being aligned plus supporting technical factors maintains positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is clearly BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and this bearish bias is consistently present across all 15 bars leading to entry. Additionally, there's persistent negative delta from bars -11 through -6 (ranging from -88,240 to -11,044), indicating sustained selling pressure, with the final bar showing only weak buying pressure (+940 delta). The Long scores remain consistently low (0-3 range) throughout the entire period, never reaching the favorable threshold of 4+, while spread momentum has been deteriorating from WIDE back to NARR, suggesting weakening upward momentum.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction, which removes our strongest +36pp edge and creates headwind. Combined with consistently low long scores (averaging only 1.4 over last 5 bars), this setup lacks the bullish conviction needed despite having adequate range and aligned SMA spread. The risk-reward is unfavorable when our primary structural edge is working against us.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 timeframe is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the delta shows consistent selling pressure with negative values in 9 of the last 10 bars, including strong selling at -88,240 and -71,282. While the system identified this as a high-volume node, the price action shows clear evidence of selling absorption rather than buying support, with the recent bounce at bar -2 immediately rejected with negative delta at entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (our strongest edge at +36pp is working against us), and the long score is very low at 1.6, indicating weak bullish momentum across timeframes. While we have adequate range and aligned SMA spread, the combination of our most powerful edge being negative plus consistently low long scores creates unfavorable conditions that override the baseline positive expectancy.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: ** H1 bullish structure supports the LONG direction, and bar -2 showed strong buying pressure that pushed price higher. The pullback to entry appears normal profit-taking rather than structural breakdown, with no clear opposing signals to override the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure perfectly aligned for this LONG trade. While the long score is low, we have favorable range% indicating movement potential and aligned SMA spread providing additional edge.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The setup shows supportive price action with strong buying pressure on the entry bar (-1) showing +69,666 delta and 0.20% range, indicating genuine momentum. H1 structure is BULL which aligns with the LONG direction, and the final bar shows improved long scores (2/4). While there were some negative delta readings in the middle section (-12, -4, -3), the recent action shows buyers stepping in with conviction at this high-volume node zone.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: Clear bearish volume divergence against the LONG setup. Despite price grinding higher from 326.77 to 327.31 over the last 4 bars, delta remains consistently negative (-88,240, -71,282, -53,214, -11,044), indicating selling pressure into the rally. This selling absorption combined with H1 BEAR structure creates strong headwinds against the long entry at 327.36.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is directly opposed to our LONG direction (BEAR vs BULL needed), which eliminates our strongest edge (+36pp). Additionally, the long score is extremely low at 0.4, indicating weak momentum conditions. While we have adequate range and aligned SMA spread, the combination of opposed H1 structure and very weak momentum signals creates a clearly unfavorable setup that falls below our trading threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in buying pressure with consistently negative delta from bars -6 through -1 (-14,752 to -11,044), indicating sustained selling pressure right into the entry. Additionally, the H1 timeframe is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are extremely weak (0-2) across all recent bars while Short scores are consistently higher (1-3). This represents strong structural opposition to the long trade.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (BEAR vs BULL needed), which removes our strongest +36pp edge and creates headwind. Additionally, the consistently low long scores (averaging 0.4) indicate weak bullish momentum across all recent bars.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration in the final 4 bars before entry, with consistently negative delta (-51K, -88K, -71K, -53K) indicating strong selling pressure. Additionally, the H1 timeframe remains BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long scores are consistently 0 throughout the entire sequence, showing no bullish conviction. The widening spreads (+0.31 to +0.38) combined with persistent selling pressure suggests this bounce attempt is weak and likely to fail.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is OPPOSED to our LONG direction (losing our +36pp edge), long scores are consistently very low across all recent bars, and the wide positive SMA spread works against long entries. While range is adequate, the combination of opposing H1 structure with poor momentum signals creates a clearly unfavorable setup that falls well below our edge criteria.

While there is positive delta in recent bars and some buying pressure, the higher timeframe bearish structure and consistently poor Long scores present clear warning signs against this setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags - H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), extremely low long score averaging 0.4, and SMA spread is also opposed to our LONG direction.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 timeframe is strongly BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the recent price action shows consistent selling pressure with large negative deltas (-261K on bar -1, -151K on bar -4). The final bar before entry shows a significant breakdown with 0.19% range and massive selling volume, indicating strong bearish momentum that conflicts with taking a long position here.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows clear opposition across our strongest edges - H1 structure is BEAR (opposed to LONG), creating a -36pp headwind against our strongest backtested advantage. The consistently low long scores (averaging 2.0) and opposed SMA spread alignment compound the negative signals. While we have adequate range, the combination of opposed H1 structure with weak momentum signals creates a clearly unfavorable risk profile that falls well below our edge criteria.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows extremely heavy selling pressure with -261,306 delta and massive volume spike to 157,318, indicating strong institutional selling right at the entry level. The H1 structure remains firmly BEAR across all timeframes except the lower ones, and there's a clear pattern of increasing selling pressure in the last 4-5 bars with consistently negative deltas ranging from -107K to -261K. This heavy absorption at the entry price suggests the "high-volume-node zone" may be acting as resistance rather than support.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags that stack against us. The H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest edge working against us at -36pp), we're in an absorption zone with low range% that historically underperforms, and both the long score and SMA spread are unfavorable. With our primary edge reversed and supporting indicators all negative, this falls into the "clearly unfavorable" category that warrants rejection.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1/M15/M5 structure remains consistently BEAR which strongly supports the SHORT direction. While the M1 has flipped to BULL and recent bars show some buying pressure (positive deltas at -9, -8, -7), the overall context shows selling pressure dominating with significant negative deltas on bars -13, -11, -5, -4, -3, and -2. The range percentages are adequate (0.15-0.23% on recent bars) indicating the market is moving rather than absorbing, and this appears to be a typical pullback within the broader bearish structure.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is substantial enough to overcome the low short score and opposed SMA spread. The adequate range percentage indicates sufficient movement for the setup to develop properly. While supporting indicators are mixed, the primary structural edge combined with SECONDARY zone performance (47.31% mid-tier) maintains positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

However, the bounce from 625.64 to 626.26 in the last bar suggests potential reversal at this high-volume node zone, and the system's pre-qualification should be respected absent clearer structural opposition.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite unfavorable supporting indicators (low long score, small ranges, opposed SMA spread), the H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp above baseline. The recent bars show increasing volume and momentum building from 625.64 to 626.26, suggesting potential breakout energy.

While bar -1 shows a bounce with negative delta (-92,765), this suggests the rally lacks conviction and buying support. The consistent bearish structure across all timeframes (M15/M5/M1 all BEAR) and low long scores (mostly 0-1) indicate this bounce is likely a weak counter-trend move in a downtrend rather than a sustainable reversal.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite low supporting indicators, the H1 structure is BULL-aligned which provides our strongest edge at +36pp above baseline. The recent price action shows a clear dip at 11:20 followed by recovery at 11:21 with high volume, suggesting potential reversal momentum.

The recent bars show increasing volatility (Range% expanding from 0.04% to 0.11%) indicating the market is moving rather than absorbing. Although delta has been negative in recent bars (-238K, -99K), this creates a potential spring setup at the high-volume node, and the system has already pre-qualified this zone as favorable for entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite the strong H1 alignment edge (+36pp), this setup shows multiple clear red flags. The average range of 0.058% puts us in the absorption zone where we should skip trades, and the consistently low long scores (mostly 1s) with opposed SMA spread indicate weak momentum conditions.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which supports the LONG direction, and we see consistent positive delta in the final 6 bars (-6 through -1) indicating sustained buying pressure into the entry zone. While the range percentages are relatively low (0.01-0.04%), suggesting some choppiness, the momentum shift from negative to positive delta around bar -6 with high volume (23,865) shows institutional interest, and the narrowing spread from -0.30 to -0.13 indicates potential breakout conditions are developing.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which alone justifies the trade given our positive expectancy system. While the low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone and momentum is weak, the SMA spread alignment adds supporting conviction. The EPOCH system pre-qualification combined with PRIMARY zone designation and our most powerful edge being favorable outweighs the short-term weakness in momentum indicators.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: This setup shows clear warning signs against a LONG entry. The recent price action (bars -3 to -1) displays strong selling pressure with large negative deltas (-24,698, -131,800, -117,543), indicating institutional selling into this zone. Additionally, all timeframes except H1 are BEAR aligned, and the Long scores are consistently 0-1 throughout the entire sequence, showing no buying interest at these levels.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags - H1 structure is opposed to our LONG direction (removing our strongest +36pp edge), we're in an absorption zone with minimal range movement (<0.12%), and both long scores and SMA spread are working against us. While we normally trade pre-qualified setups, the combination of opposed structure, lack of movement, and weak momentum signals creates an unfavorable risk profile that overrides the default trade bias.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear deterioration into the entry with strong selling pressure on bars -4 through -1, including delta readings of -77,624, -103,516, -191,552, and -166,905. The final bar before entry shows massive selling volume (98,697) with heavy negative delta (-166,905), indicating institutional selling rather than a bounce setup. Additionally, all lower timeframes (M15/M5/M1) are BEAR aligned against this LONG entry, creating structural headwinds that override the H1 BULL bias.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup violates multiple key edges simultaneously. The H1 structure opposition removes our strongest +36pp edge, the extremely low range% (0.048%) puts us in the absorption zone where we should skip trades, and the consistently low long scores (0-1 range) show weak bullish conviction. The opposing SMA spread adds another unfavorable factor, creating a clearly suboptimal setup despite the PRIMARY zone qualification.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which supports the LONG direction, and recent bars (-3, -1) show strong positive delta (+29,608, +22,027) indicating buying pressure at this level. While the spread is negative (-0.19) suggesting we're below key moving averages, the positive delta absorption and supportive higher timeframe structure outweigh this concern for a system-qualified high-volume node entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The critical H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, making this a fundamentally sound setup despite mixed supporting indicators. While the low range suggests absorption and SMA spread is opposed, the H1 bull alignment with our LONG direction is the most powerful predictor in our backtested system. The moderate long score provides additional support, and our PRIMARY zone designation confirms this is a qualified opportunity with positive expectancy.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which aligns with the LONG direction, and recent bars (-3, -1) show positive delta indicating buying pressure emergence after earlier selling. While the M15 remains BEAR creating some headwind, the transition from negative to positive delta in the final bars suggests buyers are stepping in at this high-volume-node zone, supporting the systematic entry.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is substantial enough to overcome the opposing factors. While the low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone and the SMA spread is opposed, the H1 bull alignment combined with consistent positive volume delta in recent bars (+29,608, +11,190, +22,027) and medium long scores provides sufficient edge above our baseline expectancy for this pre-qualified PRIMARY zone setup.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which supports the LONG direction, and we see positive delta emerging in the last two bars (+29,608 at 11:15 and +11,190 at 11:16) indicating buying pressure is building near the entry level. While the M15 is BEAR creating some cross-current, the recent high-volume bar at 11:15 with strong positive delta suggests institutional interest at these levels, which aligns with the system's high-volume-node identification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp), which is decisive for taking this trade despite mixed supporting indicators. While the low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone and the SMA spread is opposed, the primary structure edge significantly outweighs these concerns and keeps us well above break-even expectancy.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong bullish confirmation with massive positive delta (+29,608) and significant volume spike (23,865), indicating strong buying pressure right before entry. While the overall sequence shows mixed price action with negative delta in earlier bars, the H1 structure remains BULL which supports the long direction, and the entry bar's strong buying activity suggests institutional participation at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge (+36pp), which is the most critical factor for trade success. While the low range% suggests we're in an absorption zone and the SMA spread is opposed, the massive volume spike with positive delta (+29,608) on the entry bar shows institutional interest.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong bullish momentum with +7,772 delta and 83% volume increase, suggesting buying pressure is emerging at this level. While the overall trend shows consistent selling pressure (negative deltas), H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and the recent price action from 492.16 to 492.33 indicates potential reversal from the low. The system's identification of this as a high-volume-node zone entry combined with the supportive higher timeframe structure and emerging buying pressure justifies taking the trade.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge at +36pp, which more than compensates for the opposing SMA spread and low range conditions. While the setup isn't ideal with limited price movement and unfavorable spread dynamics, the PRIMARY zone qualification combined with H1 alignment creates positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is fully supportive with H1/M15/M5/M1 all BEAR across recent bars, and the short scores are consistently in the 3-4 range which is adequate. The final bar shows negative delta (-26,432) with decent range (0.29%) and the spread has turned negative (-0.11), indicating selling pressure is emerging. While the positive delta in earlier bars shows some buying interest, the recent shift to selling pressure at this high-volume-node zone aligns well with the SHORT setup.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge at +36pp, which is significant. While short scores are low indicating weak momentum, we have sufficient range for movement and SMA spread alignment supporting the direction. The consistent bearish structure across all timeframes (H1/M15/M5/M1 all BEAR) creates a favorable environment for this SHORT setup despite moderate momentum signals.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The structure is highly supportive with H1 BEAR (after flipping from BULL at bar -10) and all lower timeframes aligned BEAR. The price action shows a clear rejection pattern from the 326.24 high at 11:00, followed by consistent selling pressure with Short scores of 4, 4, 4, 2, 4 in the final 5 bars. The spread has compressed from +1.19 to +0.06, indicating momentum is fading and ready for a bearish break below the current range.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure is perfectly aligned BEAR for this SHORT, giving us our strongest backtested edge of +36pp above baseline. While the short score is low at 2.0, the range is adequate at 0.13% and the narrowing SMA spread supports the SHORT direction. The H1 alignment alone makes this trade statistically favorable despite weaker supporting indicators.

The spread has compressed from +1.22 to +0.24, indicating weakening bullish momentum. While delta remains positive showing some buying pressure, the recent bars show manageable range percentages (0.08-0.20%) and Short scores of 2-4, which combined with the bearish structure alignment supports taking this pre-qualified system entry.

Average range of 0.14% exceeds the 0.12% threshold for favorable movement conditions. While short score is low, the H1 alignment edge is so powerful that it overrides weaker supporting indicators, providing well above baseline expectancy.

The H1 structure remains BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the Long score has dropped to just 1, indicating very unfavorable conditions. Despite the system's pre-qualification, the immediate M1 action shows absorption and selling pressure that contradicts the bullish thesis.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BULL which supports the LONG direction, and recent bars show decent volatility (0.03-0.06% range) indicating the market is moving rather than absorbing. While the delta has been consistently negative showing selling pressure, the system has identified this as a high-volume-node entry at $492.14, and the recent bars (-3 to -1) show high volume with improving momentum scores, suggesting potential exhaustion of the selling pressure near this support level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is decisive even with mixed supporting indicators. While the low average range and opposed SMA spread are unfavorable, the volume shows consistent high activity with improving delta momentum in recent bars. The H1 alignment alone pushes this well above our breakeven threshold, making it a statistically favorable trade despite suboptimal range conditions.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows a clear bullish momentum surge from 10:45-10:53 with consistently positive delta (+37K to +171K), rising prices from $323.39 to $325.19, and widening spreads (+0.03 to +0.98). This represents strong buying pressure and upward momentum directly opposing the SHORT setup. The M1 timeframe has flipped to BEAR but the underlying volume delta confirms buyers are in control at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple strong unfavorable factors converging. The H1 structure is BULL (opposed to our SHORT), which eliminates our strongest +36pp edge and actually works against us. The short score is consistently low (1-5 range, averaging 3.2), indicating weak bearish momentum. While the range is adequate and we're in a secondary zone, the combination of opposed H1 structure and weak short signals creates a clearly unfavorable risk profile that falls below our trade threshold.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows a clear bullish momentum surge from 10:45-10:53 with sustained positive delta (+37K to +171K), rising prices from 323.39 to 325.23, and consistently wide spreads (+0.03 to +0.98). This represents strong buying pressure and upward momentum directly opposing the SHORT direction, with the spread widening to nearly +1.00 at entry time, indicating the market is in a bullish phase rather than ready for a reversal.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup shows multiple clear red flags against our SHORT direction. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT), giving us a significant disadvantage against our strongest +36pp edge. The short score is very low at 3.2, and the SMA spread is strongly positive and widening, indicating continued upward momentum. With our strongest edge working against us and supporting indicators also unfavorable, this presents a clearly unfavorable risk profile despite the acceptable range.

  Actual: LOSS | AGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows strong bullish momentum completely opposing this SHORT setup. From bars -8 through -1, we see consistent positive delta (buying pressure) with values reaching +171,604, accompanied by a rising spread from -0.03 to +0.80, indicating strong upward momentum. The recent bars show sustained buying with decent volatility (0.12-0.28% range), suggesting continued upward pressure that directly conflicts with a SHORT entry at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple red flags working against it. The H1 structure is BULL (opposed to our SHORT direction), which eliminates our strongest +36pp edge and creates headwind. The short score is consistently low across recent bars, and the SMA spread is strongly positive and widening, both opposing the short direction. While range is adequate, the combination of opposed structure and momentum indicators suggests this trade lacks the favorable conditions that improve our win rate.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows strong bullish momentum that directly contradicts the SHORT entry. From bars -8 to -1, we see consistent positive delta (+37K to +171K), rising prices from 323.39 to 325.23, and increasingly positive spread (+0.03 to +0.80). The H1 structure remains BULL throughout, and we're entering at the peak of a clear uptrend with wide spreads and strong buying pressure - this creates high risk for a SHORT position.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags against our strongest edges. H1 structure is BULL (opposed to SHORT direction, removing our +36pp edge), short score is consistently low <4, and SMA spread is wide positive (opposed to short direction). While range is adequate, the alignment of our two strongest edge categories (H1 structure and SMA spread) are both working against this short setup, making this a clearly unfavorable trade despite the pre-qualification.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and this bearish bias has been persistent throughout the entire 15-bar sequence. Additionally, the Long scores are extremely weak (never exceeding 4, mostly 0-2) while delta shows consistent selling pressure in the early bars (-23K to -197K delta from bars -15 to -10). Although recent bars show some buying pressure, the overwhelming structural and momentum evidence suggests this long entry is fighting against the prevailing trend.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup has multiple clear red flags that stack against our edges. The H1 structure is OPPOSED (our strongest -36pp edge working against us), we're in an absorption zone with sub-0.12% range (skip condition), and both long score and SMA spread are unfavorable. While our system has positive expectancy, this represents a clearly unfavorable setup where multiple indicators align negatively.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The final bar (-1) shows strong buying pressure with +85,591 delta and decent range (0.51%), suggesting momentum into the entry. While M15 and M5 timeframes are BEAR, the H1 remains BULL which provides higher timeframe support for the LONG direction. The spread has turned positive (+0.23) and the long score improved to 4, indicating the setup is gaining bullish momentum despite recent choppiness.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly present with H1 structure aligned BULL for this LONG trade. While the Long Score is low at 2.2, the good range% (0.35%) shows adequate movement and the SMA spread is aligned and widening favorably. The H1 alignment edge alone provides significant positive expectancy above our baseline.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and the final bar (-1) shows a strong bounce from 692.31 to 692.64 with decent range (0.06%) and reduced negative delta (-19,671 vs much worse readings earlier). While the recent bars show predominantly negative delta indicating selling pressure, the price action demonstrates resilience around this zone with the bounce occurring right at the entry level, suggesting potential support.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest edge (+36pp) is clearly favorable with H1 structure aligned BULL for this LONG trade. While the low range suggests absorption and the SMA spread is opposed, the H1 alignment is our most reliable predictor and this PRIMARY zone setup maintains positive expectancy well above our breakeven threshold. The pre-qualified EPCH2 system combined with perfect structural alignment outweighs the secondary negative factors.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: H1 structure remains BULL which supports the LONG direction, and the final bar (-1) shows a recovery move from 692.29 to 692.64 with reduced negative delta (-19,671 vs previous heavy selling). While there's been consistent selling pressure in recent bars, the price action shows potential stabilization around this high-volume node zone, and the higher timeframe structure alignment justifies letting the system work.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite multiple weak indicators (low long score, insufficient range, opposed SMA spread), the H1 BULL structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp, which is sufficient to overcome other weaknesses. The setup remains above our profitable baseline expectancy, and the recent bounce from 692.29 to 692.64 shows some buying interest emerging.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent selling pressure with negative delta on 11 of the last 15 bars, including strong selling (-234,651 and -94,077) in the final two bars before entry. The multi-timeframe structure is problematic with M15, M5 bearish against the long direction, and consistently low long scores (mostly 0-1) throughout the sequence. Additionally, the recent bars show narrow ranges (<0.05%) suggesting absorption rather than directional momentum, making this a poor risk/reward setup despite the system qualification.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite multiple unfavorable indicators (low long score, absorption zone range, opposed SMA spread), the H1 BULL alignment provides our strongest backtested edge at +36pp. The PRIMARY zone context and pre-qualification by EPOCH system support taking this trade, though the low movement environment and mixed signals warrant reduced confidence.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows consistent heavy selling pressure with negative delta across most recent bars (-234,651 at bar -1, -184,008 at bar -2), indicating strong distribution at these levels. Additionally, the recent bars show very low volatility (Range% consistently below 0.04%) suggesting absorption rather than healthy buying interest. The combination of persistent negative delta and compressed ranges creates unfavorable conditions for a long entry at this level.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: While H1 structure provides our strongest edge (+36pp), this setup has multiple significant red flags that override it. The average range of 0.028% is well below our 0.12% threshold where we should skip absorption zones, and the consistently low long scores (0-1 range) combined with opposed SMA spread create a setup that contradicts our backtested favorable conditions. The lack of meaningful price movement and poor momentum indicators suggest this trade lacks the characteristics that historically improve our win rate.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The price action shows clear absorption and lack of momentum despite being at a high-volume node. Range% has been consistently below 0.10% for the last 11 bars (since 10:28), indicating choppy, sideways action rather than directional movement. Additionally, the Long scores are extremely weak at 0-1 throughout the entire sequence, and delta shows mixed signals with no sustained buying pressure - the last bar shows essentially neutral delta (+9) after oscillating between buyers and sellers.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The H1 structure alignment provides our strongest backtested edge (+36pp), which alone makes this trade statistically favorable. However, the extremely low range (0.046% vs 0.12% threshold) suggests we're in an absorption zone with minimal movement, and the opposed SMA spread adds headwinds. While not a high-conviction setup, the primary edge combined with system pre-qualification maintains positive expectancy.

Additionally, the spread is deeply negative at -1.34, indicating strong bearish momentum on the moving average cross. The recent delta pattern shows mixed buying/selling pressure without clear bullish conviction in a bearish structural environment.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: This setup violates our strongest edge - H1 structure is BEAR (opposed to LONG direction), which historically reduces win rates significantly.

The recent price action shows persistent negative delta (selling pressure) in bars -11 through -1, with particularly heavy selling in bars -9 and -8 (-418K and -417K delta respectively), indicating strong institutional selling that hasn't been absorbed.

Although H1 remains BULL, the immediate M1 action shows buyers failing to maintain control with declining spread momentum (-0.10%) and weakening participation.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: Despite multiple unfavorable supporting indicators (low long score, minimal range suggesting absorption zone, and opposed SMA spread), the H1 structure provides our strongest edge at +36pp when aligned with BULL for LONG trades. The price action shows recent narrowing momentum and we're in a PRIMARY zone which historically performs well.

  Pass 1 Reasoning: The H1 structure is BEAR which directly opposes this LONG entry, and the recent price action shows sustained selling pressure with large negative deltas (-418,662 at bar -4 and -417,786 at bar -3). While there was a brief bounce in the last bar with positive delta (+139,725), this appears to be a counter-trend move against the prevailing bearish structure across all higher timeframes (H1/M15/M5 all BEAR), making this a low-probability setup.

  Actual: WIN | DISAGREE

  Pass 1 Reasoning: ** The recent negative delta surge and collapse in long scores from 2 to 0-1 show clear deterioration in buying conditions right before entry. While H1 structure remains bullish, the immediate M1 price action shows selling pressure that contradicts the long thesis at this specific entry point.
  Pass 2 Reasoning: The strongest backtested edge (H1 Structure alignment) is clearly favorable, providing a +36pp win rate boost above our baseline. While the low range% and weak long scores are concerning, the SMA spread alignment provides additional support. The PRIMARY zone performance shows decent mid-range outcomes, and our positive expectancy system means even mediocre setups can be profitable at 1.5R targets.

  Last Bar Indicators:
