1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Indicator Analysis application is a Streamlit-based web dashboard that
analyzes trading indicator performance across the four Epoch entry models:

  EPCH01 - Continuation through Primary Zone
  EPCH02 - Rejection from Primary Zone
  EPCH03 - Continuation through Secondary Zone
  EPCH04 - Rejection from Secondary Zone

The application helps answer key questions:
  - Which entry models perform best?
  - Does Health Score actually predict trade success?
  - Which of the 10 health factors matter most?
  - Do rejection trades need different indicators than continuation trades?

TO RUN THE APPLICATION:
  cd C:\XIIITradingSystems\Epoch\02_zone_system\12_indicator_analysis
  streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502

Then open http://localhost:8502 in your browser.

SIDEBAR FILTERS (Left Side)
---------------------------
Use the sidebar to filter data displayed in all tabs:

  Date Range: Choose "All Data", "This Year", "This Month", "This Week", or "Today"

  Models: Toggle which entry models to include (EPCH01-04)

  Trade Type: Filter to "Continuation" (EPCH01/03) or "Rejection" (EPCH02/04)

  Direction: Filter to "LONG" or "SHORT" trades only

  Tickers: Select specific stock symbols

  Outcome: Filter to "Winners" or "Losers" only

The sidebar shows how many trades and optimal events are loaded with current filters.


================================================================================
3. TAB 1: METRICS OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This is your primary analysis sandbox for equity (share) trades.

+-------------------+
| SUMMARY CARDS     |
+-------------------+

At the top you'll see 5 key metrics:

  TOTAL TRADES: How many trades match your filters

  WIN RATE: Percentage of trades where price reached Maximum Favorable Excursion
            (MFE) before Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)

  WINS / LOSSES: Raw count of winning and losing trades

  AVG POINTS: Average price movement per trade (positive = profitable)

  TOTAL POINTS: Sum of all price movements across all trades


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-001: WIN RATE BY MODEL         |
+-------------------------------------+

WHAT IT SHOWS:
  Performance breakdown for each entry model (EPCH01-04)

HOW TO READ IT:
  - Summary Table shows Wins, Losses, Win%, and Avg Points per model
  - Bar Chart shows win (green) and loss (red) counts side by side

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
  - Which models have highest win rate?
  - Which models have most trades (sample size)?
  - Are any models significantly better/worse?


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-002: TRADE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY|
+-------------------------------------+

WHAT IT SHOWS:
  How much price moves favorably (MFE) vs adversely (MAE) from entry to 3:30 PM

KEY METRICS:
  Median MFE%: Half of trades moved at least this much in your favor
  Median MAE%: Half of trades moved at least this much against you
  Overall Ratio: MFE/MAE ratio (>1 means favorable moves exceed adverse)

HOW TO READ THE CHARTS:

  MFE Histogram: Distribution of favorable price moves
    - Tall bars on right = many trades with large favorable moves

  MAE Histogram: Distribution of adverse price moves
    - Tall bars on left = most trades have small adverse moves (good!)

  Scatter Plot:
    - Each dot is a trade
    - X-axis = how much it moved against you (MAE%)
    - Y-axis = how much it moved for you (MFE%)
    - Dots ABOVE the diagonal line = trade moved more favorably than adversely


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-003: MFE/MAE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS  |
+-------------------------------------+

WHAT IT SHOWS:
  Probability that price reaches MFE before MAE (P(MFE First))
  This is the foundation for Monte Carlo simulations.

KEY METRICS:
  P(MFE First): The percentage of trades where favorable move happens first
  Time to MFE: How many minutes until maximum favorable move
  Time to MAE: How many minutes until maximum adverse move

CONFIDENCE RATINGS:
  HIGH: 100+ trades, results are reliable
  MEDIUM: 50-99 trades, results likely reliable
  LOW: 30-49 trades, use caution
  INSUFFICIENT: <30 trades, not statistically significant

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
  - P(MFE First) > 50% suggests positive edge
  - Shorter time to MFE than MAE suggests price moves favorably quickly


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-004: SIMULATED OUTCOME ANALYSIS |
+-------------------------------------+

WHAT IT SHOWS:
  What would win rate be at different stop-loss and take-profit levels?

HOW IT WORKS:
  The system walks through 1-minute price bars and simulates hitting your stop
  or target. This is independent of actual exit data.

HOW TO READ THE GRID:
  - Rows = different stop loss percentages (0.25% to 2%)
  - Columns = different target percentages (0.5% to 4%)
  - Cell values = simulated win rate at that stop/target combo

OPTIMAL PARAMETERS:
  The system highlights the stop/target combination with best expectancy
  (risk-adjusted return).


+-------------------------------------+
| MONTE AI - RESEARCH ASSISTANT       |
+-------------------------------------+

Generates a prompt you can copy/paste into Claude for AI-powered analysis.
The prompt includes all the calculation results from this tab.


================================================================================
4. TAB 2: OPTIONS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Mirrors the Metrics Overview tab but for options contracts instead of shares.

KEY DIFFERENCE:
  Win Condition: Option price higher at 3:30 PM than at entry
  (exit_pct > 0 means win, exit_pct <= 0 means loss)


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-O01: OPTIONS WIN RATE BY MODEL  |
+-------------------------------------+
Same as CALC-001 but for options trades.
Also breaks down by CALL vs PUT contracts.


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-O02: OPTIONS MFE/MAE DISTRIBUTION|
+-------------------------------------+
Same as CALC-002 but measuring option price movements.


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-O03: OPTIONS SEQUENCE ANALYSIS  |
+-------------------------------------+
Same as CALC-003 but for options.


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-O04: OPTIONS VS UNDERLYING      |
+-------------------------------------+
Compares how options move relative to the underlying stock.

KEY INSIGHT:
  Leverage Ratio = how much more (or less) options moved compared to shares
  Good options trades amplify MFE more than they amplify MAE.


================================================================================
5. TAB 3: INDICATOR ANALYSIS
================================================================================

This tab analyzes whether entry indicators (especially Health Score) actually
predict trade outcomes.

There are 4 sub-tabs:


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-005: HEALTH SCORE CORRELATION   |
+-------------------------------------+

CORE QUESTION:
  "If DOW AI sees Health Score 8+ at entry, should it recommend the trade
  more confidently?"

HEALTH SCORE BUCKETS:
  CRITICAL (0-3): Worst conditions
  WEAK (4-5): Below average
  MODERATE (6-7): Average
  STRONG (8-10): Best conditions

KEY METRICS:
  Correlation (r): How strongly Health Score relates to winning
    - r > 0.1 with p<0.05: Significant positive correlation
    - r near 0: Health Score doesn't predict outcomes

  Optimal Threshold: The minimum Health Score that maximizes win rate improvement

  Lift: How much win rate improves vs baseline
    - Example: +5pp lift means 5 percentage points better than average

HOW TO INTERPRET:
  1. Look at "Win Rate by Bucket" chart
     - Does STRONG beat CRITICAL? By how much?

  2. Check the correlation coefficient
     - Is it positive and statistically significant (p<0.05)?

  3. Review threshold analysis
     - What's the optimal minimum Health Score to filter by?
     - How many trades would you exclude?


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-006: FACTOR IMPORTANCE          |
+-------------------------------------+

CORE QUESTION:
  "Of the 10 Health Score factors, which ones actually matter?"

THE 10 FACTORS:
  Structure (4 factors):
    - H4 Structure: 4-hour trend alignment
    - H1 Structure: 1-hour trend alignment
    - M15 Structure: 15-minute trend alignment
    - M5 Structure: 5-minute trend alignment

  Volume (3 factors):
    - Volume ROC: Volume rate of change vs baseline
    - Volume Delta: Buy vs sell pressure
    - CVD Slope: Cumulative volume delta trend

  Price (3 factors):
    - SMA Alignment: Fast SMA vs Slow SMA position
    - SMA Momentum: SMA spread widening/narrowing
    - VWAP Position: Price vs VWAP

KEY METRICS:
  Lift: Win rate when factor is "healthy" minus win rate when "unhealthy"
    - High positive lift = factor predicts winners
    - Near zero = factor doesn't matter
    - Negative = factor is inverted (unhealthy is better!)

  Prevalence: How often the factor is in "healthy" state
    - Low prevalence + high lift = rare but powerful signal

HOW TO INTERPRET:
  1. Look at "Factor Importance Ranking" chart
     - Which factors have highest lift?

  2. Check "Healthy vs Unhealthy Comparison"
     - Big difference = factor matters
     - Small difference = factor doesn't help

  3. Review correlation matrix
     - Highly correlated factors are redundant


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-007: INDICATOR PROGRESSION      |
+-------------------------------------+

CORE QUESTION:
  "What changes between entry and outcome?"

This analysis tracks how indicators change bar-by-bar from trade entry.

KEY CONCEPTS:
  Winner Path: How indicators change from ENTRY to MFE (maximum profit)
  Loser Path: How indicators change from ENTRY to MAE (maximum loss)

EARLY WARNING SIGNALS:
  The system identifies indicator drops that predict losing trades.

  Example: "Health Score drop of -2 within 5 bars catches 65% of losers
           but only 25% of winners" = useful exit signal

FACTOR DEGRADATION:
  Shows which health factors deteriorate fastest before trades fail.

  Flip Rate: Percentage of trades where factor went from healthy to unhealthy
  Early Flip: How many flipped within first 5 bars

HOW TO INTERPRET:
  1. Bar-by-Bar Chart: Do winners and losers diverge quickly?
     - Early divergence = opportunity to exit losers early

  2. Early Warnings: Can you catch losers before hitting stop?
     - Look for signals with high loser hit rate and low winner hit rate

  3. Factor Degradation: Which factors fail first?
     - These are your early warning indicators


+-------------------------------------+
| CALC-008: REJECTION DYNAMICS         |
+-------------------------------------+

CORE QUESTION:
  "Do rejection trades (EPCH02/04) require different indicators?"

CONTINUATION vs REJECTION:
  Continuation (EPCH01/03): Trades that go through the zone
  Rejection (EPCH02/04): Trades that reverse from the zone

This analysis has 4 sub-sections:

  8A: TIME-TO-MFE
  Do rejection trades reach MFE faster?
  - Faster = need quicker profit taking

  8B: HEALTH SCORE INVERSION
  Is Health Score relationship reversed for rejection?
  - If CRITICAL beats STRONG, scoring is inverted

  8C: FACTOR INVERSION
  Which specific factors work backwards for rejection?
  - Inverted factors should use opposite logic

  8D: EXHAUSTION INDICATORS
  Do extreme values (very high or very low) predict rejection success?
  - Exhaustion = market moved too far, ready to reverse

VERDICT:
  At the bottom, the system tells you whether rejection trades need
  different scoring than continuation trades.


================================================================================
6. TAB 4: ARCHIVED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

This tab preserves the original dashboard functionality for reference.

SUB-TABS:
  Overview: Performance summary with model comparison
  Continuation: EPCH01/03 specific analysis
  Rejection: EPCH02/04 specific analysis
  Indicators: Deep dive into individual indicators
  Health: Health score analysis using original data
  Data: Raw data explorer with CSV export

NOTE: This tab uses the legacy "is_winner" flag from the trades table,
which may differ from the MFE<MAE win condition used in Metrics Overview.


================================================================================
7. UNDERSTANDING WIN CONDITIONS
================================================================================

The application uses DIFFERENT win conditions in different contexts:

+-----------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------+
| LOCATION              | WIN CONDITION                      | WHY?            |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Metrics Overview      | MFE time < MAE time                | Potential win   |
| (CALC-001 to 004)     | "Did price move favorably first?"  | Could have won  |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Options Analysis      | exit_pct > 0                       | Actual result   |
| (CALC-O01 to O04)     | "Was option profitable at 3:30?"   | Did win         |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Indicator Analysis    | MFE time < MAE time                | Same as Metrics |
| (CALC-005 to 008)     | From mfe_mae_potential join        |                 |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Archived Analysis     | is_winner flag                     | Legacy data     |
| (Original tabs)       | From trades/optimal_trade tables   | May differ      |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------+

POTENTIAL vs REALIZED:
  mfe_mae_potential: Entry to 3:30 PM (potential outcome if held)
  optimal_trade: Entry to Exit (actual trade duration)


================================================================================
8. INTERPRETING RESULTS
================================================================================

WHAT'S A GOOD WIN RATE?
  >60%: Excellent, strong edge
  50-60%: Good, positive edge
  45-50%: Marginal, may not cover costs
  <45%: Losing system (unless R:R compensates)

WHAT'S GOOD CORRELATION?
  r > 0.2: Strong predictive relationship
  r = 0.1-0.2: Moderate, useful signal
  r < 0.1: Weak, limited value
  p < 0.05: Statistically significant
  p >= 0.05: Could be random noise

WHAT'S MEANINGFUL LIFT?
  >10pp: Very significant, use this filter
  5-10pp: Significant, worth considering
  2-5pp: Moderate, may help at margins
  <2pp: Not meaningful, don't filter on this

SAMPLE SIZE MATTERS:
  100+ trades: Results are reliable
  50-99 trades: Results likely reliable
  30-49 trades: Interpret with caution
  <30 trades: Too small, don't trust results


================================================================================
9. QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

HEALTH SCORE BUCKETS:
  CRITICAL: 0-3 (worst)
  WEAK: 4-5
  MODERATE: 6-7
  STRONG: 8-10 (best)

MODEL TYPES:
  Continuation: EPCH01, EPCH03 (through zone)
  Rejection: EPCH02, EPCH04 (from zone)

KEY FORMULAS:
  Win Rate = Wins / Total Trades * 100

  For LONG: MFE% = (MFE Price - Entry) / Entry * 100
