Indicator Analysis Synthesis Report
Epoch Trading System - January 4, 2026

Executive Summary

Health Score validates but with moderate effect — r=0.151 correlation is statistically significant (p<0.0001) but explains only ~2% of outcome variance. The score works directionally but isn't a strong standalone filter.
Factor hierarchy is clear — M5 Structure (+22.6pp) and M15 Structure (+16.0pp) dominate. Two factors are essentially dead weight: VWAP Position (+1.1pp) and Volume Delta (-1.5pp shows negative lift).
Rejection trades show exhaustion dynamics — Lowest quintile CVD Slope achieves 58.4% win rate (+17.8pp lift) and lowest SMA Spread achieves 63.5% (+22.9pp). This confirms rejection setups work best at price exhaustion, not trend alignment.
EPCH2 SHORT is your edge — 61-78% win rates across Health Score buckets. EPCH4 and EPCH1/3 lack statistical significance or show poor performance.
Early warning system is viable — Health Score drop of ≥1 point within 3 bars captures 42% of eventual losers with only 24% false positive rate.

Critical Finding: Two-Score System Required
The data strongly suggests rejection trades need different evaluation criteria than continuation trades:
Evidence for Separate Scoring
IndicatorContinuation LiftRejection LiftInterpretationCVD Slope (Q1 extreme)Traditional+17.8ppExhaustion beats alignmentSMA Spread (Q1 extreme)Traditional+22.9ppTight spread = reversal imminentVolume Delta+9.1pp-1.3ppInverted for rejectionVolume ROC+14.8pp+4.5ppLess important for rejection
Recommendation: Develop an "Exhaustion Score" for rejection models (EPCH2/EPCH4) that rewards:

Extreme low CVD Slope (counter-trend volume exhaustion)
Tight SMA Spread (price compression before reversal)
Neutral/inverted Volume Delta interpretation


DOW AI Configuration Changes
Priority 1: Immediate Implementation
1.1 Remove Dead Factors from Health Score
REMOVE: VWAP Position (+1.1pp lift - no predictive value)
REMOVE: Volume Delta (-1.5pp lift - negative predictor overall)

RESULT: Convert to 8-factor system, rescale labels:
  STRONG: 7-8 (previously 8-10)
  MODERATE: 5-6 (previously 6-7)
  WEAK: 3-4 (previously 4-5)
  CRITICAL: 0-2 (previously 0-3)
1.2 Implement Model-Specific Minimum Thresholds
EPCH2 SHORT: No minimum (performs across all scores)
EPCH2 LONG:  Minimum Health Score >= 6 (MODERATE+)
             Rationale: 25% WR in CRITICAL vs 57-75% in MODERATE/STRONG
EPCH4:       Disable until further investigation
             Rationale: Poor performance across all configurations
1.3 Add Early Exit Warning
TRIGGER: Health Score drops ≥1 point within 3 bars of entry
ACTION:  Flag for tightened stop or early exit consideration
EXPECTED: Capture 42% of losers, accept 24% false positive rate
Priority 2: Near-Term Development
2.1 Create Exhaustion Score for Rejection Trades
pythondef calculate_exhaustion_score(bars, direction):
    """
    Alternative scoring for EPCH2/EPCH4 rejection trades
    Higher score = better exhaustion conditions for mean reversion
    """
    score = 0
    
    # CVD Slope at extreme (Q1) = +2 points
    cvd = calculate_cvd_slope(bars)
    if cvd_in_lowest_quintile(cvd, direction):  # Opposing direction exhaustion
        score += 2
    
    # SMA Spread tight (Q1) = +2 points  
    spread = abs(sma9 - sma21) / sma21
    if spread_in_lowest_quintile(spread):
        score += 2
        
    # M5 Structure showing reversal setup = +1 point
    # (First opposing structure after extended move)
    if m5_reversal_setup(bars, direction):
        score += 1
        
    # Volume spike (potential capitulation) = +1 point
    if vol_roc > 50:  # High volume at zone
        score += 1
        
    return score  # 0-6 scale
```

**2.2 Implement Direction-Specific Logic**
```
FOR ALL MODELS:
  - SHORT trades: Reduce minimum score requirements
    Rationale: SHORT systematically outperforms LONG across all models
    
  - LONG trades: Require higher Health Score threshold
    Rationale: LONG needs stronger confirmation to achieve comparable results
```

### Priority 3: Validation Required

**3.1 H4 Structure Investigation**
```
ISSUE: H4 Structure shows 0 trades with "healthy" alignment
HYPOTHESIS: Either calculation bug or threshold too strict
ACTION: Review H4 structure detection logic in structure/h4_structure.py
```

**3.2 EPCH4 Deep Dive**
```
ISSUE: 437 trades but poor win rates across configurations
QUESTIONS:
  - Is secondary zone identification accurate?
  - Are rejection signals at secondary zones meaningful?
  - Should EPCH4 be merged with EPCH2 or eliminated?
```

## Model-Specific Adjustments

### EPCH2 (Primary Zone Rejection) — Your Core Edge

| Direction | Current State | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| SHORT | 61-78% WR, n=296 | **Expand aggressively**, no score filter needed |
| LONG | 25-75% WR depending on score | **Filter to MODERATE+ only** (Health Score ≥6) |

**Specific Rules:**
```
EPCH2 SHORT:
  - Entry: Accept all Health Scores
  - Exit: Use early warning system (HS drop ≥1 in 3 bars)
  - Consider: Test Exhaustion Score as entry enhancement
  
EPCH2 LONG:
  - Entry: Require Health Score ≥6 (cuts 55% of trades, +32pp lift)
  - Alternative: Require M5 + M15 Structure aligned (both healthy)
EPCH1/EPCH3 (Continuation) — Insufficient Data
ModelTradesStatusEPCH157Collect more data before optimizingEPCH346Collect more data before optimizing
Interim Recommendation: Keep running but don't make configuration changes until n≥100 per model.
EPCH4 (Secondary Zone Rejection) — Problematic
DirectionTradesWin RateRecommendationSHORT19717.2%Disable - systematic loserLONG24038.5%Investigate - better but below baseline
Action: Disable EPCH4 SHORT immediately. Review secondary zone identification logic before continuing EPCH4 LONG.

Factor Reweighting Proposal
Based on predictive lift, here's a revised weighting scheme:

Proposed New Scale: 0-8.5 points (if using decimals) or 0-17 (if doubling for integers)

Next Steps / Further Research
Immediate (This Week)

Disable EPCH4 SHORT — Stops the bleeding
Implement EPCH2 LONG filter — Health Score ≥6 requirement
Investigate H4 Structure — Why zero "healthy" trades?

Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

Build Exhaustion Score prototype — Test on historical EPCH2 data
Add early warning system — Health Score drop monitoring
Remove VWAP and Volume Delta — Simplify to 8-factor system

Medium-Term (30+ Days Data)

Collect EPCH1/EPCH3 samples — Need n≥100 for conclusions
Validate Exhaustion Score — Forward test on rejection trades
A/B test weighted vs unweighted — Confirm factor reweighting improves results

Research Questions Requiring More Data

Does the early warning system work equally for continuation and rejection?
What's the optimal Exhaustion Score threshold for EPCH2?
Is EPCH4's poor performance due to secondary zone quality or model logic?
Does direction bias (SHORT > LONG) persist across market conditions?

Key Takeaway
The Health Score system works but is suboptimal. The most impactful finding is that rejection trades operate on different dynamics than continuation trades — they benefit from exhaustion signals rather than trend alignment.
Your edge is concentrated in EPCH2 SHORT, which performs well regardless of Health Score. The immediate wins come from filtering EPCH2 LONG more aggressively and disabling EPCH4 SHORT. The longer-term opportunity is building a dedicated Exhaustion Score for rejection trades.
