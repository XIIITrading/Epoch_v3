> # System Modification Request

> ## Dev Rules

1. > Do not generate any code without my explicit instructions
2. > Do not assume anything (naming conventions, modules, directories). Ask for clarification or request files to read directly.
3. > Always include .txt documentation at the end in two files:
   - > **AI-readable**: Complete context for use in future AI conversations without requiring the full script directory
   - > **Human-readable**: Teaching-focused explanation of how the script works and how to implement similar patterns elsewhere
4. > Post review of the documentation, please ask clarifying questions or request supporting scripts, schema, or documentation to ensure a full understanding.
