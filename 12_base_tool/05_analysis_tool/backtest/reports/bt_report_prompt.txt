                         ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please analyze the backtest and provide findings on the following:

1. EXECUTION VALIDATION
   - Confirm all modules passed (Backtest, Entry Events, Exit Events, Optimal Trade)
   - Note any validation failures or warnings

2. PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
   - Total trades, wins, losses, win rate
   - Total P&L in R, average R per trade
   - Profit factor, gross profit, gross loss

3. MODEL BREAKDOWN (EPCH1-4)
   - Trade count per model
   - Win rate per model
   - P&L per model
   - Identify best/worst performing models

4. DIRECTION ANALYSIS
   - LONG vs SHORT performance comparison
   - Win rates by direction
   - P&L by direction
   - Flag any significant directional bias

5. EXIT REASON ANALYSIS
   - Breakdown by exit type (TARGET, STOP, EOD, etc.)
   - P&L contribution per exit reason

6. PROBLEM TICKERS
   - Identify any tickers with disproportionate losses
   - Note patterns (all SHORT, all LONG, specific model, etc.)

7. HEALTH SCORE EXIT SIGNALS
   - Average R if exit at each health level (0-10)
   - Win rate at each health level
   - Identify health thresholds that signal exit

8. DOW AI ALIGNMENT CHECK
   - HTF alignment rate (H4+H1)
   - MTF alignment rate (M15+M5)
   - Volume alignment rate (ROC+Delta+CVD)
   - Indicator alignment rate (SMA+VWAP)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    MODEL-SPECIFIC HEALTH INDICATOR ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: The four models represent two distinct pattern types that require
SEPARATE indicator analysis. Continuation and Reversal patterns have different
indicator relevance profiles.

PATTERN CLASSIFICATION:
  CONTINUATION PATTERNS (price continues through zone):
    - EPCH_01: Continuation - Primary Zone
    - EPCH_03: Continuation - Secondary Zone

  REVERSAL PATTERNS (price rejects/reverses at zone):
    - EPCH_02: Reversal - Primary Zone
    - EPCH_04: Reversal - Secondary Zone

9. CONTINUATION PATTERN ANALYSIS (EPCH_01 + EPCH_03)

   For each of the 10 health indicators, analyze ONLY continuation trades:

   STRUCTURE FACTORS (Steps 1-4):
   | Indicator     | Win Rate When Aligned | Win Rate When Opposed | Signal Strength |
   |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
   | H4 Structure  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | H1 Structure  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | M15 Structure | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | M5 Structure  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |

   VOLUME FACTORS (Steps 5-7):
   | Indicator     | Win Rate When Aligned | Win Rate When Opposed | Signal Strength |
   |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
   | Volume ROC    | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | Volume Delta  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | CVD Direction | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |

   INDICATOR FACTORS (Steps 8-10):
   | Indicator        | Win Rate When Aligned | Win Rate When Opposed | Signal Strength |
   |------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
   | SMA Alignment    | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | SMA Momentum     | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | VWAP Location    | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |

   >> KEY CONTINUATION INDICATORS: [List top 3 most predictive for wins]
   >> IRRELEVANT INDICATORS: [List any with <5% win rate differential]
   >> CONTINUATION HEALTH THRESHOLD: [Recommend minimum score for entry]

10. REVERSAL PATTERN ANALYSIS (EPCH_02 + EPCH_04)

   For each of the 10 health indicators, analyze ONLY reversal trades:

   STRUCTURE FACTORS (Steps 1-4):
   | Indicator     | Win Rate When Aligned | Win Rate When Opposed | Signal Strength |
   |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
   | H4 Structure  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | H1 Structure  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | M15 Structure | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | M5 Structure  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |

   NOTE: For reversals, OPPOSED HTF structure may actually be favorable
   (trading against trend = reversal). Analyze if ChoCh signals on M5/M15
   correlate with wins.

   VOLUME FACTORS (Steps 5-7):
   | Indicator     | Win Rate When Aligned | Win Rate When Opposed | Signal Strength |
   |---------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
   | Volume ROC    | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | Volume Delta  | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | CVD Direction | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |

   NOTE: Volume exhaustion/climax patterns may signal reversal setups.
   Analyze if high Volume ROC with opposing Delta signals successful reversals.

   INDICATOR FACTORS (Steps 8-10):
   | Indicator        | Win Rate When Aligned | Win Rate When Opposed | Signal Strength |
   |------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
   | SMA Alignment    | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | SMA Momentum     | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |
   | VWAP Location    | [Calculate]          | [Calculate]          | [STRONG/WEAK]   |

   NOTE: SMA NARROWING may be more relevant for reversals than WIDENING.

   >> KEY REVERSAL INDICATORS: [List top 3 most predictive for wins]
   >> CONTRARIAN SIGNALS: [List indicators where OPPOSED alignment helps]
   >> IRRELEVANT INDICATORS: [List any with <5% win rate differential]
   >> REVERSAL HEALTH THRESHOLD: [Recommend minimum score for entry]
