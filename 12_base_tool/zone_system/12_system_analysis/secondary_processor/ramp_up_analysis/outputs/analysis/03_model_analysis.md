## Model Definitions
| Model | Zone Type | Trade Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| EPCH1 | PRIMARY | CONTINUATION | Momentum continuation with macro trend |
| EPCH2 | PRIMARY | REJECTION | Counter-trend rejection at primary zone |
| EPCH3 | SECONDARY | CONTINUATION | Counter-trend continuation through secondary zone |
| EPCH4 | SECONDARY | REJECTION | Rejection back toward macro trend |

## Performance Data

| Model | Zone | Trade Type | Total | Wins | Losses | Win Rate | Avg R |
|-------|------|------------|-------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| EPCH1 | PRIMARY | CONTINUATION | 74 | 46 | 28 | 62.2% | 1.56R |
| EPCH2 | PRIMARY | REJECTION | 781 | 477 | 304 | 61.1% | 1.36R |
| EPCH3 | SECONDARY | CONTINUATION | 63 | 48 | 15 | 76.2% | 2.35R |
| EPCH4 | SECONDARY | REJECTION | 676 | 487 | 189 | 72.0% | 2.08R |

## Questions for Analysis
1. Which model has the highest win rate?
2. Do Primary Zone trades perform better than Secondary Zone trades?
3. Are there models that should be prioritized or avoided?

## Claude Analysis Instructions
Analyze the model performance data and provide:
1. Ranking of models by risk-adjusted performance
2. Observations about Zone Type impact
3. Recommendations for model-specific indicator thresholds
