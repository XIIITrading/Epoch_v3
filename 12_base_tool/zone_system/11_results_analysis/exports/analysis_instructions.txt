MODULE 10: ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
XIII Trading LLC | v1.0 | December 2025
================================================================================

When I provide you with a JSON export file from Module 10, please analyze
the following areas. Reference MODULE10_DOCUMENTATION.txt for field definitions.

================================================================================
A. OVERALL TRADE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

Provide a comprehensive summary including:

1. PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
   - Total trades, win rate, net R, expectancy
   - Gross profit vs gross loss, profit factor
   - Compare to baseline expectations

2. BY MODEL ANALYSIS
   - EPCH1-4 performance comparison
   - Which models are profitable? Which are struggling?
   - Win rate vs expectancy (high win rate doesn't mean profitable)
   - Sample size considerations

3. BY DIRECTION ANALYSIS  
   - LONG vs SHORT performance
   - Any directional bias in the data?
   - Does market context explain direction performance?

4. BY EXIT TYPE ANALYSIS
   - STOP, TARGET_3R, TARGET_CALC, CHOCH, EOD breakdown
   - What percentage of exits are stops vs targets?
   - CHOCH effectiveness - is it helping or hurting?
   - EOD forced exits - are we holding too long?

5. BY ZONE TYPE ANALYSIS
   - PRIMARY vs SECONDARY zone performance
   - Which tier (T1/T2/T3) is performing best?
   - Zone quality vs trade outcomes

================================================================================
B. CONFLUENCE POINT IMPACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Analyze how these factors affected trade outcomes:

1. VWAP ALIGNMENT
   - Compare win rates: VWAP-aligned trades vs non-aligned
   - Average R for VWAP-aligned vs non-aligned
   - Does entry position relative to VWAP matter?
   - LONG trades above VWAP vs below VWAP
   - SHORT trades below VWAP vs above VWAP

2. SMA ALIGNMENT (SMA9 and SMA21)
   - Win rates when SMA9 > SMA21 (bullish MA) vs SMA9 < SMA21
   - Does entry vs SMA position correlate with outcomes?
   - Trend-aligned trades (direction matches SMA trend) vs counter-trend

3. MARKET STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT
   - Win rates by structure_align count (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
   - Does more timeframe alignment = better outcomes?
   - Which timeframe matters most? (M5, M15, H1, H4)
   - How does dominant_struct alignment affect results?

4. VOLUME ANALYSIS
   - Win rates by vol_delta_class (LOW/NORMAL/HIGH/EXTREME)
   - Does high volume confirm better entries?
   - Volume trend impact (EXPANDING vs CONTRACTING)
   - Relative volume thresholds

5. HEALTH SCORE ANALYSIS
   - Win rates by health_label (STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK)
   - Average R by health score ranges
   - Should we avoid WEAK health entries?
   - What health score threshold optimizes results?

6. COMBINED CONFLUENCE
   - Best performing combination of factors
   - Which factors have highest correlation with winners?
   - Minimum confluence requirements for entry

================================================================================
C. ENTRY TIMING ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Examine timing patterns to optimize entries:

1. TIME OF DAY ANALYSIS
   - Parse entry_time to find best trading windows
   - Performance by hour (9:30-10:30, 10:30-11:30, etc.)
   - Morning vs midday vs afternoon entries
   - First 30 minutes performance

2. BARS TO MFE
   - How many bars typically to reach MFE?
   - Are we entering too early or too late in the move?
   - Time from entry to optimal exit

3. STRUCTURE BREAK TIMING
   - How does m5_last_break timing affect entries?
   - Are we entering right after breaks or delayed?

4. VOLUME AT ENTRY
   - Volume characteristics of winning vs losing entries
   - Does waiting for volume confirmation help?

5. ENTRY FILTERS TO CONSIDER
   - Based on the data, what entry filters would improve results?
   - Time filters, confluence filters, health score filters

================================================================================
D. EXIT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Evaluate exit management:

1. CAPTURE EFFICIENCY
   - What percentage of MFE are we capturing?
   - Distribution of capture efficiency
   - Comparison: actual PnL vs optimal PnL

2. EXIT EVENT TIMELINE
   - What events precede losing trades?
   - Health degradation patterns before stops
   - Warning signs we're missing

3. CHOCH EFFECTIVENESS
   - Does CHOCH exit before stops hit?
   - CHOCH R-multiple vs final exit R-multiple
   - Is CHOCH saving us or cutting winners?

4. TARGET ANALYSIS
   - TARGET_3R vs TARGET_CALC - which is better?
   - Are calculated targets realistic?
   - Should we adjust R-multiple targets?

5. HOLD TIME ANALYSIS
   - Bars from entry to exit by exit type
   - Winners vs losers hold time comparison
   - Are we holding too long or exiting too early?

6. MAE ANALYSIS
   - Maximum adverse excursion on winners vs losers
   - Stop placement effectiveness
   - Could tighter/wider stops improve results?

================================================================================
E. PATTERNS TO TRACK (MULTI-DAY)
================================================================================

As we accumulate more days of data, track these patterns:

1. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
   - Note sample sizes for each analysis
   - Mark findings that need more data to confirm
   - Set thresholds (e.g., need 30+ trades per model)

2. MARKET REGIME PATTERNS
   - How does performance change with market_context?
   - Bullish days vs bearish days vs neutral days
   - H4 dominant direction impact

3. TICKER PATTERNS
   - Any tickers consistently outperforming?
   - High-confluence tickers vs low-confluence
   - Sector or characteristic patterns

4. MODEL EVOLUTION
   - Track EPCH1-4 performance over time
   - Are any models consistently failing?
   - Model adjustments needed?

5. EDGE DECAY
   - Monitor expectancy trend over time
   - Win rate stability
   - Average R trends

================================================================================
F. OUTPUT FORMAT
================================================================================

When providing analysis, please structure responses as:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 sentences)
   - Key takeaway
   - Primary recommendation

2. DETAILED FINDINGS
   - Use tables for comparisons
   - Include actual numbers/percentages
   - Note sample sizes

3. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS
   - Specific filters to implement
   - Trade management adjustments
   - Risk considerations

4. QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
   - What additional data would help?
   - What patterns need more confirmation?
