EPOCH DOW AI - VALIDATION RULES & THRESHOLD PERFORMANCE
Generated: 2026-01-24 08:58:06
================================================================================

PURPOSE: Document current validation thresholds and their actual performance
to identify which rules are working and which need adjustment.

================================================================================
1. CANDLE RANGE THRESHOLDS
================================================================================

CURRENT RULES:
    >= 0.15%  → GOOD  → Favor TRADE
    0.12-0.15% → OK   → Neutral
    < 0.12%   → SKIP  → Favor NO_TRADE

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE BY THRESHOLD:

Bucket                       Total  Correct   Accuracy     Wins   Win Rate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:
- Does GOOD candle range actually correlate with higher win rates?
- Is the 0.12% SKIP threshold too conservative or too aggressive?
- Should thresholds vary by ticker volatility profile?

================================================================================
2. VOLUME DELTA STATUS THRESHOLDS
================================================================================

CURRENT RULES:
    LONG:  vol_delta > 0 → FAVORABLE, else NEUTRAL
    SHORT: vol_delta > 0 → FAVORABLE (BUG!), else WEAK

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE BY DIRECTION + STATUS:

Direction  Status          Total  Correct   Accuracy     Wins   Win Rate    Avg Delta
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LONG       FAVORABLE         984      510      51.8%      416      42.3%      +201231
LONG       NEUTRAL           773      372      48.1%      401      51.9%      -132350
SHORT      FAVORABLE         871      447      51.3%      389      44.7%      +135798
SHORT      WEAK              951      582      61.2%      360      37.9%   -147057438

CRITICAL ANALYSIS:
- Compare SHORT + FAVORABLE win rate when avg_delta is POSITIVE vs baseline
- If positive delta hurts SHORT trades, this confirms the logic bug
- Expected: SHORT trades should have HIGHER win rate when delta is NEGATIVE

================================================================================
3. VOLUME ROC THRESHOLDS
================================================================================

CURRENT RULES:
    vol_roc >= 30% → ELEVATED
    vol_roc < 30%  → NORMAL

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE BY THRESHOLD:

ROC Bucket                   Total  Correct   Accuracy     Wins   Win Rate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:
- Does elevated volume actually improve trade outcomes?
- Should we distinguish between volume surge WITH trend vs AGAINST trend?

================================================================================
4. HEALTH SCORE THRESHOLDS (Rule-Based Fallback)
================================================================================

CURRENT RULES (used when API parsing fails):
    health_score >= 7 → TRADE, HIGH confidence
    health_score 5-6  → TRADE, MEDIUM confidence
    health_score = 4  → NO_TRADE, MEDIUM confidence
    health_score < 4  → NO_TRADE, HIGH confidence

These rules are used as fallback when Claude response parsing fails.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THRESHOLD OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:
   - Correct vol_delta status logic for SHORT trades
   - Negative delta should be FAVORABLE for shorts

2. DATA-DRIVEN THRESHOLD REVIEW:
   - Analyze optimal candle_range threshold by ticker
   - Analyze optimal vol_roc threshold by model type

3. DIRECTION-AWARE RULES:
   - Add explicit "aligned with direction" signals
   - Create composite alignment score
