EPOCH DOW AI - PER-INDICATOR ACCURACY BREAKDOWN
Generated: 2026-01-24 08:58:06
================================================================================

PURPOSE: Analyze prediction accuracy broken down by each indicator value.
Identify which indicator states correlate with correct vs incorrect predictions.

================================================================================
1. CANDLE STATUS ACCURACY BY DIRECTION
================================================================================

Status       Direction     Total  Correct   Pred Acc     Wins   Win Rate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOOD         LONG            895      435      48.6%      371      41.5%
GOOD         SHORT          1058      599      56.6%      439      41.5%
OK           LONG            186      102      54.8%       76      40.9%
OK           SHORT           250      151      60.4%       91      36.4%
SKIP         LONG            676      345      51.0%      370      54.7%
SKIP         SHORT           514      279      54.3%      219      42.6%

================================================================================
2. VOLUME DELTA - DETAILED ANALYSIS BY DIRECTION AND MAGNITUDE
================================================================================

*** THIS IS THE KEY DIAGNOSTIC FOR THE VOL DELTA BUG ***

For SHORT trades:
- "strong_positive" delta = heavy buying pressure = SHOULD hurt win rate
- "strong_negative" delta = heavy selling pressure = SHOULD help win rate

If strong_positive has HIGHER win rate for LONG but LOWER for SHORT,
the logic is working correctly in reality but the STATUS label is wrong.


Direction  Status       Delta Magnitude     Total  Correct   Pred Acc   Wins   Win Rate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LONG       NEUTRAL      strong_negative       372      190      51.1%    183      49.2%
LONG       FAVORABLE    strong_positive       538      249      46.3%    211      39.2%
LONG       NEUTRAL      weak_negative         401      182      45.4%    218      54.4%
LONG       FAVORABLE    weak_positive         446      261      58.5%    205      46.0%
SHORT      WEAK         strong_negative       951      582      61.2%    360      37.9% (should be best)
SHORT      FAVORABLE    strong_positive       468      250      53.4%    200      42.7% *** EXAMINE ***
SHORT      FAVORABLE    weak_positive         403      197      48.9%    189      46.9%

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
- If SHORT + strong_negative has HIGHER win rate than SHORT + strong_positive,
  then the ACTUAL market behavior is correct but our STATUS LABELS are inverted.
- The model receives "FAVORABLE" for positive delta on shorts, but positive
  delta actually hurts short trades.

================================================================================
3. SMA ALIGNMENT ACCURACY BY DIRECTION
================================================================================

Expected patterns:
- LONG + BULL SMA should have higher win rate (aligned)
- SHORT + BEAR SMA should have higher win rate (aligned)
- Counter-aligned combinations should have lower win rates


SMA      Direction     Total  Correct   Pred Acc     Wins   Win Rate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
BEAR     LONG            804      412      51.2%      342      42.5% (counter)
BEAR     SHORT          1000      567      56.7%      387      38.7% (aligned)
BULL     LONG            949      468      49.3%      473      49.8% (aligned)
BULL     SHORT           822      462      56.2%      362      44.0% (counter)

================================================================================
4. H1 STRUCTURE ACCURACY BY DIRECTION
================================================================================

Expected patterns:
- LONG + BULL H1 should have higher win rate (aligned)
- SHORT + BEAR H1 should have higher win rate (aligned)


H1       Direction     Total  Correct   Pred Acc     Wins   Win Rate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
BEAR     LONG            197       94      47.7%      109      55.3% (counter)
BEAR     SHORT           268      105      39.2%      155      57.8% (aligned)
BULL     LONG            301      167      55.5%      188      62.5% (aligned)
BULL     SHORT           173      115      66.5%       55      31.8% (counter)
NEUT     LONG           1259      621      49.3%      520      41.3%
NEUT     SHORT          1381      809      58.6%      539      39.0%

================================================================================
SUMMARY FINDINGS
================================================================================

Review the data above to answer:
1. Does the vol_delta bug actually hurt SHORT trade predictions?
2. Are aligned SMA/H1 structures predictive of wins?
3. Which indicator combinations are most/least reliable?
