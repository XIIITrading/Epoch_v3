================================================================================

PURPOSE: Analyze HOW the model interprets indicator data in its reasoning.
Identify patterns in correct vs incorrect predictions.

KEY FOCUS AREAS:
1. How does the model describe vol_delta for SHORT trades?
2. Does the model correctly interpret "FAVORABLE" signals?
3. What reasoning patterns lead to false positives/negatives?

================================================================================
CORRECT TRADE PREDICTIONS (True Positives)
================================================================================
These are cases where the model said TRADE and the trade was a WIN.
Study these to understand what good reasoning looks like.

Indicators Reported:
  Candle: 0.0700% (SKIP)
  Vol Delta: -19,550 (NEUTRAL) 
  Vol ROC: -17.00% (NORMAL)
  SMA: BULL | H1: NEUT

Snapshot: The extremely low candle range of 0.07% creates a SKIP condition, indicating insufficient volatility for reliable entry execution. While the 74% historical win rate is favorable and SMA shows bullish alignment, the negative volume delta suggests selling pressure. Wait for increased volatility above skip threshold before entering this long position.
